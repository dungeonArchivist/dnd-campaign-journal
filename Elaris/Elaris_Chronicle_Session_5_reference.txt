DETAILED CONTINUITY – SCENE BY SCENE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Scene 1 – MORNING CONTRACT RUN
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Borian departed the Hall for Grayharp Market with the sealed message
for Steward Halden Varrick. Delivery completed without issue; receipt
properly signed. No interference or tail during the route. Borian
returned to the Hall and received payout of 6 sp for the delivery.

With approval from Feldrin, Borian accepted the next two tasks due to
their close proximity. Rat-sign inspection at the municipal grain shed
revealed no tunneling or spoor; notice signed by clerk. Frost-Kiln
temperature assessment performed cleanly; apprentice verified reading,
and day-shift clerk signed the slip. Returned to Hall for payout of
1 gp 4 sp for the three completed tasks. No hazards or branching
events occurred during these civic checks.

Scene 2 – MARKET BREAKFAST AND OBSERVATION
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
At Cartwright’s Tiny Grill, Borian purchased two rolls and birch brew.
No suspicious behavior or hostile observers detected. Seating remained
available; no unintended social tension in the cramped space. Borian
completed meal uneventfully, maintaining low profile in artisan tier.

Scene 3 – RIZENWASH BATHHOUSE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Full-service bath purchased (8 sp). Standard wash, soaproot scrub, and
soak performed. No narrative hooks or NPC leads triggered. Bathhouse
attendant gave information about procuring tinctures; referenced Varrin
and Fenwater as reliable sources. NOTE: The mention of Fenwater shop
does not create new Herda branch; it is generic apothecary direction.

Scene 4 – VARRIN’S TINCTURES & BREWS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Borian inquired about restorative tinctures and healing potions. Varrin
explained RAW-compliant inventory; no sale occurred. Borian asked about
unusual items; Varrin provided overview of several non-magical but
exotic alchemical goods (Breather’s Draught, Wandering-Tongue, Shade-
Drop, Sigh-Jar). No purchase made. No secret interaction triggered.

Scene 5 – PREPARATION AT TERRACE OVERLOOK
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Borian arrived at the terrace approximately after the 9th Bell (~3:30
PM). He meditated and maintained situational awareness. Shard-bearer
arrived on foot; approached openly. No threat behavior. Borian relayed
Aleron’s message precisely as instructed: Aleron seeks preservation of
memory, not ownership, and offers support or distance as requested.

Shard-bearer clarified he obtained the shard only recently from Tavren.
He confirmed he could not face Herda alone and requested Aleron’s
presence. No contradiction to prior continuity; no false claims made.

Scene 6 – RETRIEVING ALERON
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Borian located Aleron at the Upper Ridge Overlook per prior agreement.
Aleron accepted the request immediately. No hesitation or additional
conditions. Aleron acknowledged Borian’s intermediary role and prepared
to ascend.

Borian formally stepped out of the arc, stating this is where his role
in their story ends. Aleron proceeded alone up the terrace stairs.

NOTE: The actual meeting between Aleron and the shard-bearer proceeds
OFF-SCENE per player declaration.

Scene 7 – RETURN TO ANCHORFALL INN
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Borian returned to Anchorfall. He informed Torven that the job he was
asked to relay (the shard-related matter) was concluded in spirit,
though payment had not yet been rendered. Torven affirmed he would pass
coin quietly when Aleron comes.

Borian ate roast hen dinner and honeyed-brandy cider. No new hooks or
NPC entanglements. Retired to room, performed gear maintenance, and
entered trance.

ALLIES / RELATIONSHIPS CHANGES
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Aleron: Strengthened trust; sees Borian as honest intermediary.
- Torven: Minor increase in respect; acknowledges Borian’s discretion.
- Shard-bearer: Neutral-to-Respectful; no ongoing tie unless revived.

ITEMS / CONTRACTS CHANGES
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Items: No additions or losses.
- Contracts Completed:
  * Parcel Delivery – COMPLETED
  * Rat-Sign Check – COMPLETED
  * Frost-Kiln Temperature Check – COMPLETED
  * Grayharp Message Delivery – COMPLETED
- Shard Recovery (Aleron): NARRATIVE CLOSURE PENDING, but Borian’s
  involvement concluded. Payment owed but not yet delivered.
- Granary Understructure & Missing Fisher: UNCHANGED and STILL OPEN.

HIDDEN DM THREADS (NOT FOR CODEX)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Aleron’s identity: No reveal yet, but his connection to Surnhal
  memory-looms remains active. He will complete the shard-bearer
  meeting off-screen. Potential future hook: lineage restoration.
- Shard-bearer’s role: He is a terminal vector for this branch; no
  reappearance unless Aleron fails. His knowledge ties back to minor
  Surnhal line events; not a major NPC.
- Herda Fenwater: Her world-state may shift depending on Aleron’s
  off-screen outcome. No immediate danger or instability.
- Grayharp/Kiln/Grain-shed tasks: Routine civic worldbuilding; no
  hidden events triggered.
- Torven: Passively monitors Borian’s reputation. Positive trajectory.
- City Timeline: Sunset approaching during Aleron-shard-bearer meetup.
  No world-events scheduled this night.
