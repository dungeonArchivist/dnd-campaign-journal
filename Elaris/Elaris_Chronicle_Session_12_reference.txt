ELARIS CHRONICLE – SESSION XII – "PRESSURE WITHOUT FOOTPRINTS"
=======================================================================

TIMEFRAME
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Day 12 (late afternoon and night) through Day 13 (early evening).

Approximate clock:
- Day 12 ~16:00–18:00 – Anchorfall Inn; initial movements and contacts.
- Day 12 ~18:00–22:00 – City circulation (upper tiers, harbor routes).
- Day 12 ~22:00–24:00 – Return to Anchorfall; messaging and rest.
- Day 13 ~00:00–04:00 – Trance at Anchorfall Inn.
- Day 13 ~04:00–09:00 – Morning work; guild and Hall engagements.
- Day 13 ~09:00–16:30 – Perimeter assessment outside south gate.
- Day 13 ~16:30–18:00 – Hall reporting, payment, and evening return.

WEATHER / ATMOSPHERE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Cold winter conditions persist. Clear skies, steady air. No storms or
precipitation. The city remains operational and orderly, but social
behavior reflects increased caution: lower voices, reduced loitering,
and subtle shifts in authority posture without public declaration.

LOCATIONS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Anchorfall Inn (private room, common room)
- Frostmere Row streets and lower-tier routes
- Kessa’s apartment building (interior access)
- Lower-tier transition corridor (suspected disappearance route)
- Upper-tier tavern (Brass Knot)
- Harborfront routes and docks
- Hall of Free Companies
- Ledger / freight guild office
- Bakery café (mid-tier)
- South Gate and landward exterior perimeter paths

SESSION SUMMARY (HIGH LEVEL)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Investigated Kessa’s disappearance in depth, confirming she never
  returned home and identifying evidence of deliberate movement through
  maintenance-adjacent environments.
- Identified a spatial seam along Kessa’s known route; evidence supports
  accidental transition as a plausible cause, paralleling Edrin’s case.
- Conducted multi-tier observation of city behavior, confirming quiet
  tightening of authority and early-stage narrative control.
- Completed two professional contracts: a ledger-guild escort and a Hall
  perimeter assessment, advancing economic standing and reputation.
- Eliminated landward exterior approaches as a current threat vector.
- Secured an outbound cart guard contract departing Varengate on Day 14.

DETAILED CONTINUITY – SCENE BY SCENE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Scene 1 – Anchorfall Inn: Reorientation and Intent (Day 12)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Borian regrouped at Anchorfall following prior events, receiving
  informal updates via Torven and confirming no overnight escalation.
- Determined to pursue Kessa’s disappearance directly rather than await
  official action.
- Established intent to investigate without alerting authority or
  attracting attention.

Scene 2 – Kessa’s Apartment: Interior Investigation (Day 12)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Borian accessed Kessa’s apartment discreetly; no signs of forced entry
  or post-disappearance search were found.
- Evidence recovered through observation:
  - Work gloves bearing stone dust and oil residue consistent with
    granary, frost kiln, and maintenance environments.
  - Boots and satchel missing, suggesting purposeful movement.
  - A slate containing schematic spatial notes, place abbreviations, and
    erased conclusions.
- Determined Kessa left intentionally and did not return; no struggle
  occurred within the residence.

Scene 3 – Slate Analysis: Pattern Recognition (Day 12)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Borian analyzed the slate in detail, identifying:
  - Repeated schematic shapes consistent with interior or junction spaces.
  - Time markers indicating recurring observation, not a single event.
  - Evidence of cautious erasure, implying awareness of risk.
- Concluded Kessa was tracking recurring spatial irregularities rather
  than reacting to a single anomaly.

Scene 4 – Lower-Tier Route Re-examination: Seam Identification (Day 12)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Borian retraced Kessa’s known walking route from earlier sessions.
- Identified a bounded surface along a transition corridor exhibiting
  anomalous acoustic and thermal properties.
- Confirmed presence of a seam capable of non-visual transition.
- Determined accidental entry was plausible, mirroring Edrin’s earlier
  disappearance rather than intentional access.

Scene 5 – Upper-Tier Observation: Brass Knot (Day 12)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Borian observed upper-tier conversation patterns without initiating
  contact.
- Overheard indirect references to:
  - restricted access,
  - map reclassification,
  - maintenance consolidation.
- Concluded upper-tier awareness has begun but remains fragmented and
  defensive rather than coordinated.

Scene 6 – Harbor Circuit: External Mood Check (Day 12)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Borian conducted a long return route through the harbor.
- Observed steady patrols, purposeful labor, and absence of opportunistic
  escalation.
- Determined no immediate shift in harbor security posture or criminal
  exploitation.

Scene 7 – Anchorfall Inn: Messaging and Trance (Day 12–13)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Borian sent discreet word to Arlen Rusk via Torven, relaying the seam
  hypothesis regarding Kessa.
- Entered trance around midnight; emerged fully rested at 04:00.
- No intrusion, message, or anomaly contact occurred during rest.

Scene 8 – Morning Employment: Guild and Hall Work (Day 13)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Completed a same-day escort for a ledger-adjacent guild, executing a
  clean document transfer without incident.
- Leveraged the completion to secure higher-tier work eligibility.
- Accepted a Hall contract for a landward perimeter assessment.
- Walked the exterior perimeter path from the south gate out-and-back,
  conducting baseline and close-read passes.
- Found no evidence of landward breach, approach, or external threat
  vector.

Scene 9 – Hall Reporting and Contract Securing (Day 13)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Delivered verbal perimeter assessment to the Hall; findings accepted.
- Received payment without dispute.
- Secured an outbound cart guard contract departing Day 14 at first light
  from the east road gate.
- Returned to Anchorfall for dinner and rest, concluding the day.

ALLIES / RELATIONSHIPS CHANGES
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Arlen Rusk: Provided with updated seam hypothesis; coordination remains
  indirect but active.
- Hall of Free Companies: Borian’s reliability rating improved through
  clean same-day completion and perimeter assessment.
- Ledger / freight guilds: Initial professional credibility established.

ITEMS / CONTRACTS CHANGES
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Items:
  - No items gained or lost.
- Contracts / Threads:
  - Kessa disappearance: further defined; probable accidental transition
    identified.
  - Granary understructure disturbances: still open.
  - Anomaly observations (Aleron Vale): still open.
  - Mara Rhensyr coordination: pending.
  - Outbound cart guard (Day 14): active and confirmed.

HIDDEN DM THREADS (NOT FOR CODEX)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- The seam identified along Kessa’s route aligns with non-inviting,
  probabilistic transition mechanics rather than controlled access.
- Landward perimeter stability suggests internal infrastructure remains
  the primary risk surface.
- Kessa’s tracking activity indicates independent convergence on the
  same anomalies now drawing institutional attention.

SESSION END STATE (SUMMARY)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
XP This Session: 200
XP Total: 2395

Coin:
- Earned: 2 gp (perimeter assessment)
- Total at end: 18 gp, 66 sp, 5 cp.
