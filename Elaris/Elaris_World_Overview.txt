========================================================================
WORLD OVERVIEW – The Continent of Elaris
========================================================================

Known World Overview - The Continent of Elaris
The Shape of the Land
Elaris is vast and wild - a continent where ancient empires have risen
and fallen, their ruins swallowed by forests, mountains, and sand.
It stretches from the storm-swept northern fjords to the sunburned
southern deserts, with every kind of terrain between: rolling plains
where nomads still roam, jungles so dense they swallow sound, and
mountain ranges that pierce the clouds. Civilization dots the landscape
like embers in a dark sea - isolated kingdoms, city-states, and trade
roads that bind them loosely together. Between them lies the untamed
world: places of mystery, magic, and danger where few venture and fewer
return.

A World of Balance and Fracture
Centuries ago, the Aurelian Concord united most of Elaris under peace
and learning. But that harmony shattered when the Confluence - a
celestial alignment of unknown magic-reshaped the world. Rivers changed
course, mountains split, and ancient powers long dormant began to stir.
Now, balance teeters once again. The old gods are silent, their temples
crumbling, and mortal kingdoms squabble over relics and ruins left by
their fall.
Yet amid the chaos, whispers spread of the Echoes of Creation - hidden
sanctuaries, forges, or temples said to hold remnants of the world's
making. Those who find them may rewrite the balance itself.

The Peoples of Elaris
The realm is home to countless cultures and races. The most common
include:
* Humans: adaptable, ambitious, and found in every corner of the land.
* Elves: the divided children of starlight - High Elves who linger in
  their citadels, and Wood Elves who blend with the forests.
* Dwarves: masters of the earth, builders of cities carved within
  mountains and beneath the desert.
* Halflings: traders, wanderers, and survivors who move easily between
  cultures.
* Orcs & Half-Orcs: no longer only raiders-many have built new clans
  that balance strength with honor.
* Beastfolk & Other Kin: rare peoples - tabaxi, lizardfolk, aarakocra -
  each bound to their environment and fiercely protective of it.
Elaris' cultures vary as wildly as its terrain, from the icebound tribes
of Skeldir Reach to the sand-caravans of Tir'Sarim and the floating
libraries of The Skyward Isles.

Magic and the Unknown
Magic once flowed freely through the Ley Weave, an invisible network
connecting all things. After the Confluence, much of it fractured,
leaving wild zones called Driftlands - regions where spells twist
unpredictably, and reality itself bends.
Many scholars believe repairing or mastering the Ley Weave could restore
balance to Elaris - or destroy it completely.
The gods, once ever-present, now speak only in whispers or dreams. Their
clerics perform miracles, but none can say from where the power truly
flows. Some claim the divine spark now resides in mortals themselves.

The Current Age
This is the Age of Renewal, though many call it the Age of Ruins.
The world is ripe for discovery-and for danger. The frontier towns are
thriving, adventurers are in demand, and ancient evils stir beneath
stone and sand alike.
Rumors drift across taverns and trade roads:
* Strange lights in the Vale of Ashes.
* A dragon seen circling the ruins of Khar Durim.
* A relic unearthed in the jungles of Velmara said to bend weather
  itself.
* And beneath it all, the faint thrum of the Ley Weave, calling to those
  who dare to listen.

Regional Overview of Elaris
Elaris divides naturally into five broad regions, each distinct in
climate, culture, and danger. They are roughly the size of small
nations, each with multiple biomes and trade routes connecting them
loosely together.

Northern Region - Skeldir Reach
* Climate: Subarctic tundra, glaciers, and fjords.
* People: Hardy humans, dwarves, and goliaths; small orc clans in the
  eastern mountains.
* Notable Settlement: Varengate, a fortified port city built into a
  cliffside, serving as a trade hub between Elaris and the polar isles.
* Key Landmarks:
  - The Frostforge: an ancient dwarven forge said to burn with eternal
    blue flame.
  - The Shattered Spire: remnants of a celestial tower from before the
    Confluence.

Western Region - The Verdant Marches
* Climate: Temperate woodlands, river valleys, and rolling hills.
* People: Wood Elves, halflings, humans, and beastfolk.
* Notable Settlement: Aurenvale, a sprawling trade city built along
  three rivers, famous for its open markets and guild halls.
* Key Landmarks:
  - The Whispering Woods: home to druids and fey spirits who guard the
    forest paths.
  - Elderglen Monastery: a ruined temple overtaken by nature, rumored to
    hide an ancient ley node.

Central Region - The Heartlands
* Climate: Fertile plains and mountains; mild four-season weather.
* People: Humans, dwarves, elves, and all races in trade cities.
* Notable Settlement: Highspire, the capital of the Aurelian Concord's
  remnants, now a neutral city of diplomats and mercenaries.
* Key Landmarks:
  - The Crystal Roads: translucent, rune-etched highways built by
    forgotten mages.
  - The Concord Archives: a library-fortress housing pre-Confluence
    knowledge.

Southern Region - Tir'Sarim Wastes
* Climate: Harsh desert, salt flats, and canyonlands.
* People: Nomadic tribes, dragonborn, dwarves, and exiled outcasts.
* Notable Settlement: Saphir Oasis, a trade city built around a living
  spring guarded by the Seraphine Order.
* Key Landmarks:
  - The Sunken Vaults: buried temples said to predate written history.
  - The Glass Fields: plains of melted sand from an ancient magical war.

Eastern Region - Velmara Wilds
* Climate: Tropical rainforest and coastal archipelagos.
* People: Lizardfolk, tabaxi, humans, and pirates.
* Notable Settlement: Port Selanth, a chaotic harbor-city run by
  merchant princes and corsair lords.
* Key Landmarks:
  - Temple of the Serpent Moon: half-sunken ruin dedicated to a
    forgotten deity.
  - The Skyfall Basin: crater lake where meteoric crystals imbue the
    land with unstable magic.

CORE CONTINUITY CHRONICLE SESSION 0 - “The Frost-Tide Oath”
========================================================================

Chronicle 0 – “The Frost-Tide Oath”
(Campaign Declaration: Elaris Arc II – The Northern Reclamation)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Era: Age of Renewal
Starting Region: Skeldir Reach (Northern Elaris)
Primary Locale: Varengate — fortress port carved into basalt cliffs,
gateway between the Aurelian mainland and the Polar Isles.
Timeframe: Early spring thaw, first break of sea ice.
Weather: Low clouds, sleet, and sea mist. Temperatures near freezing.
Campaign Status: Soft reset (continuity retained but not referenced
until rediscovered).

Campaign Tone & Framework
The arc begins in the borderlands of civilization — where order fades
into frozen wilds. Faith, duty, and survival will converge amid shifting
alliances between guild houses, icebound tribes, and explorers chasing
relics of the pre-Confluence age.

Borian Elmsworn, newly anointed but stripped of prior rank or title,
arrives by merchant vessel on contract as a guard-for-hire. He seeks
renewed purpose, untainted by his past service or the corruption of
coastal powers.

Campaign Mechanics
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
* XP System: RAW hybrid milestone/XP (Dungeon Master’s Companion
§Economy & Lifestyle Framework).
* Bond Confirmation Rule: Player confirmation required before any
allied NPC transitions into “Party.”
* World Continuity Threads (seeded):
  - “The Frost-Tide Charter” – a missing expedition to the northern
    isles.
  - “The Hollow Concord” – evidence that Aurelian influence persists
    within Varengate’s guild hierarchy.
  - “The Whisper Forge” – dwarven ruin emitting ley resonance beneath
    the city.
  - “The Lost Prayer” – a spiritual calling echoing through Borian’s
    dreams.

CORE CONTINUITY CHRONICLE II - "Whispers Beneath the Grain"
=======================================================================

Chronicle II – “Whispers Beneath the Grain”
(Campaign: Elaris Arc II – The Northern Reclamation)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

CHRONICLE INFO
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Timeframe (Days, Times of Day):
Day 2 in Varengate, predawn through early morning. Borian wakes from
his trance around the third bell, walks the harbor before dawn, climbs
to the high ridge as the city stirs, and reaches the western granary
shortly after first light.

Weather:
Late-winter cold with light snow and lingering sleet crust on roofs
and streets. Harbor air wet and briny, with low cloud and patchy fog
over the water.

Location(s):
Anchorfall Inn (Frostmere Row); Frostmere Row streets; Drowned Lantern
harbor-front and alley; small Tidemother shrine on the pier; working
docks; East Lane switchbacks; high ridge civic quarter and notice
board; western granary basement and storage floor.

Session Context (new arc, continuation, transition):
Continuation of the Varengate arrival arc. First formal contract hook
(rat-clearing job), continued establishment of faith presence, and
introduction of hidden undercity and harbor-guild tensions.


SUMMARY OF EVENTS (OUTLINE)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Scene 1 – Quiet Hours at Anchorfall
* Borian wakes from his elven trance around the middle of the night
  and quietly checks the hallway (Perception 21). No threats, only a
  sleeping inn.
* He descends to the common room where Torven is already at work on
  the morning’s prep. They share quiet conversation over tea and
  toast.
* Borian asks after Elden Ward, mentioning Sereth’s intention to put
  in a word for him. Torven confirms Elden often comes by in the
  evenings and agrees to keep an eye out, giving Borian a clear path
  to honest work.
* Anchorfall’s status as a safe haven is reaffirmed; Torven continues
  to see Borian as a polite but capable outsider.

Scene 2 – The Drowned Lantern Alley and Rulfen
* Borian heads toward the harbor, using the early hour to learn the
  streets around Frostmere Row and the waterfront.
* A light fall of snow and sleet reveals tracks: narrow-heeled,
  pointed-toe prints that stand out from the heavier laborers’ boots,
  leading into a side alley near the Drowned Lantern stretch of the
  docks.
* In the alley he notes a moved crate and a small broken metal clasp
  or nail near where a lock might have been fixed. The scene suggests
  a disturbed drop or tampered stash.
* Sensing he is not alone, Borian uses Prestidigitation to create a
  creaking “above” sound and a gust-like sensation meant to make the
  hidden watcher flinch, then slips out of the alley mouth to avoid
  being cornered.
* A man with a crossbow, Rulfen, approaches along the street rather
  than from the alley. He is cautious but professional, clearly not
  common guard nor random thug.
* Rulfen reveals he is an independent troubleshooter hired by a local
  guild to watch “drops” in the Drowned Lantern area that have been
  going missing. He presses gently on whether Borian is involved.
* Borian offers a partial read of the scene: the unusual footwear, the
  disturbed crate, and the broken clasp. He makes it clear he was
  curious, not complicit, and prefers to see a threat head-on rather
  than risk a knife in the back.
* He deduces aloud that hiring an outsider suggests the guild either
  lacks internal capacity or wants to keep this quiet from its own
  people. This lands with Rulfen, who neither confirms nor denies but
  notes the insight.
* Borian declines immediate entanglement but leaves a line open:
  Rulfen can contact him at the Anchorfall Inn via Torven if another
  pair of hands is needed. He tosses Rulfen the broken clasp fragment
  before departing.
(DM Note: Rulfen is a competent, observant operator with a quiet moral
floor. He tags Borian as cautious, perceptive, and not easily pushed
into opaque work.)

Scene 3 – Shrines, Names, and Lay on Hands
* Continuing along the harbor, Borian notices a small, weathered
  shrine to the Tidemother at the end of a pier, tended by local
  families. An elderly woman kneels there, clearly anxious.
* A History check (12) recalls that such shrines are common in
  Varengate for sailors and fishers; they are more household-devotional
  than formal temple.
* Borian kneels beside her, asks gently about her concern, and learns
  that her son, Joren, has gone to sea and has not yet returned. She
  fears the unpredictable northern waters.
* He takes her hands and offers a full voiced prayer to the Tidemother
  for Joren’s safe passage and for those who wait on the shore, tying
  seafaring danger to the quiet endurance of families left behind.
* The woman, moved, presses two silver pieces on him. Borian insists
  he needs no payment but ultimately accepts only one, subtly slipping
  a coin back into her hand and closing her fingers around it, saying
  he will “pay it forward” for others.
* She departs comforted; Borian leaves with +1 sp and the name “Joren”
  pinned to a growing mental map of Varengate’s people.
* Later along the docks, Borian notices a young dockhand with a rope-
  burned and cut hand. He offers to take a look.
* A clumsy initial medical inspection (Medicine 1) does little on its
  own, but Borian follows with Lay on Hands, spending 1 point from his
  pool to close the wound and restore the young man’s strength.
* The dockhand returns to work with renewed vigor and a story about
  the quiet elf who fixed his hand in a heartbeat.
(DM Note: This is the campaign’s first in-world use of Lay on Hands.
Counts as 1 training/faith scene for any future devotion or divine
focus tracking.)

Scene 4 – The High Ridge and the Notice Board
* Borian climbs the East Lane switchbacks from the harbor toward the
  high ridge, taking care to learn the switchback path and sight-lines
  over the city.
* At the top he finds a civic cluster: modest stone buildings, a pair
  of mercenaries on informal watch, and a well-used notice board.
* The board carries various posts; two stand out:
  - A rat-clearing job at the western granary, posted by Drett.
  - A notice about a missing fisherman, likely Joren or closely
    related to his situation.
* When Borian asks whether the contracts are “free for the taking” or
  require registration, the mercenaries confirm he simply tears the
  slip and then presents himself to the named contact.
* Borian chooses the rat job as a likely quick win to establish
  reputation and coin. He intentionally leaves the missing fisherman
  notice in place for now but mentally tags it for a future return.
(DM Note: The missing-fisher notice is indeed linked to Joren. This is
a seeded follow-on thread rather than an obligation.)

Scene 5 – Drett’s Granary and the Rat Fight
* At the western granary Borian meets Drett, an overworked but
  practical foreman worried about spoiled grain and unnerving noise
  from below.
* Drett explains that rats have always existed, but recently they seem
  bolder, appearing at odd hours and gnawing near the outer wall.
* Borian asks about light and access. Drett provides a hooded lantern
  and, eventually, a ring of keys to internal storage spaces.
* At the hatch leading down into the basement, Borian lights the
  lantern but leaves it above the hatch, relying on his darkvision to
  scout first.
* From the top he sees two oversized rats moving among scattered
  sacks. Along the far earth wall, the ground looks disturbed, as if a
  burrow or something similar has been pushed up recently.
* Borian casts Shield of Faith, boosting his armor, then drops to the
  basement floor with sword drawn and advances.
* Combat unfolds against two giant rats:
  - Borian uses Prestidigitation to throw a shower of sparks as he
    lunges, rattling the vermin.
  - He cuts down the first rat with heavy slashing damage.
  - The second rat, larger and subtly wrong, bites through his
    defenses once despite his raised AC.
  - Borian responds with disciplined follow-up blows, finally killing
    the larger rat. The brief fight underscores that these are not
    ordinary cellar pests.
* After combat, he uses Lay on Hands on himself, spending 4 points to
  restore his health to full. His Lay on Hands pool is now fully
  expended for the day.
(DM Note: Combat difficulty was on the light side but framed as a
solo, low-level encounter tailored to match CR 1/8 creatures with
environmental tension.)

Scene 6 – The Wall That Hums
* With the immediate threat ended, Borian sweeps the basement for more
  rats (Perception 16). No further movement, but the far earth wall
  near the disturbed ground feels subtly “wrong” to him.
* He returns upstairs, retrieves the lantern properly, and invites
  Drett to see. The foreman reluctantly joins him with a second light.
* Back at the wall, Borian conducts a closer look in full light and
  uses his senses for anything beyond the mundane.
* An Arcana check (13) reveals a faint, upward seep of magical
  influence from below. It is not an active spell or glyph, but the
  ground feels like it has been “touched” by something that left a
  residue. There is a barely-perceptible humming in his bones and a
  chill that is not simply the cellar draft.
* Borian questions Drett about tunnels, old foundations, or adjoining
  cellars. Drett explains that many warehouses and granaries in this
  part of the city once had interconnected storage tunnels; most have
  been sealed or allowed to fall into disuse, but some spaces remain
  accessible or simply forgotten.
* Nearest buildings include other storage houses, empty or lightly
  used, and a guild storehouse across the street.
* Borian advises Drett to move grain away from the suspect wall and
  to raise as much as possible off the floor until the source is
  understood. Drett, worried and grateful, pulls out a ring of keys
  so Borian can inspect neighboring storage spaces.
* The session ends with Borian and Drett in the alley behind the
  granary standing at the door of the shed ready to investigate what
  lies beyond.


SESSION END SUMMARY

  and social anchor in Varengate.
* Current Scene Location at Session End: Western granary, basement
  stair and cellar entrance, lantern lit, keys in hand, attention on
  the suspect wall and adjoining storage spaces.


WORLD CONTINUITY THREADS (HIDDEN)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
* Drowned Lantern Drops:
  A guild uses the Drowned Lantern stretch of the harbor for covert
  dead-drops. Someone has begun interfering with those drops, leaving
  disturbed crates, missing items, and small broken hardware like the
  clasp Borian found. Rulfen’s employment indicates the guild does not
  trust its own people or the Tideguard to solve this quietly.

* Missing Fisherman – “Joren”:
  The shrine scene and the missing-fisherman notice on the high-ridge
  board refer to the same situation. Joren is overdue. This may lead
  to a future contract involving sea hazards, smuggling routes, or
  something stranger in the coastal waters. Emotional hook: Borian
  has prayed for this specific name.

* Granary Seep and Undercity:
  The rats and disturbed earth are symptoms of a deeper phenomenon.
  There is an undercity or tunnel network beneath this block, and
  something magical or eldritch is bleeding upward through the soil.
  The nature of the seep may tie into regional ley disturbances or
  a local entity lairing below.

* Harbor-Guild and Civic Tension:
  The existence of independent troubleshooters like Rulfen and posted
  jobs at civic boards points to a balance of power between guilds,
  city officials, and the Tideguard. Varengate prefers problems to be
  handled off the books when possible. Borian’s choices may pull him
  toward one faction’s orbit.

* Faith and the Tidemother:
  Household-level devotion to the Tidemother reflects Varengate’s
  culture. Borian’s public prayer and results at the shrine deepen
  his reputation as a spiritually grounded outsider. This may open
  doors with small folk, fishers, and some minor clergy or wardens.

* Rules & Mechanics Reminders:
  - Concentration: When Borian takes damage while maintaining spells
    like Shield of Faith, prompt for Constitution saves to maintain
    concentration.
  - Resource Logging: Track Lay on Hands, spell slots, and similar
    features session-by-session for continuity.


STYLE & NOTES
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Tone or POV cues:
* Maintain Varengate’s feel as a hard, salt-bitten city where small
  kindnesses matter and secrets are tucked under everyday commerce.
* Keep Rulfen competent and wary rather than melodramatic. He is a
  grounded point of contact in the Drowned Lantern thread.

Formatting notes:
* Continue using 72-character max line width, plain-text, UTF-8.

Lore or cosmology notes to maintain continuity:
* The Tidemother is a local harbor spirit with overlapping aspects of
  older sea deities; keep references consistent.
* The undercity beneath Varengate should feel old, layered, and built
  atop earlier structures, not a single uniform tunnel network.

Each shows a different sign of disturbance rising from below the city,
culminating in the discovery of carved stonework under the third shed.

Afterward, Borian:
- Turns in the rat-clearance slip at the Hall and is paid 5 silver.
- Quietly takes two contracts from the board:
  * Dockside mediation at Wharf 3B (completed this session).
  * Frost-Kiln firewatch night shift (taken, not yet fulfilled).
- Travels to Wharf 3B and resolves a near-brawl between two fishing
  crews via formal mediation.
- Is paid 12 silver at the Hall for the mediation.
- Returns to Anchorfall, eats, and takes a four-hour elven trance,
  recovering from his earlier injuries.

DETAILED CONTINUITY – SCENE BY SCENE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Scene 1 – Western Granary Sheds (with Drett)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Context:
- This picks up immediately after the rat fight and cellar work from
  Session II. Borian is still bruised and bitten, but mobile.
- Drett has asked Borian to check the sheds because of "strange noises"
  and structural concerns.

Shed One:
- Borian listens at the door (Perception 16+2). He hears a slow,
  unpleasant siphoning sound and catches a faint acrid, chemical smell.
- He opens the door and observes from the threshold: ordinary storage
  contents (rope, crates, grain sacks) but an off smell and the sense
  of something underneath the floor near the back-left corner.
- He steps in cautiously, testing the boards. There is a slightly soft
  spot and subtle give near that corner.
- After moving a crate with Drett's help, Borian exposes a hairline
  crack between floorboards and a dark, damp stain.
- Borian pries up the board (Athletics 16+5 = 21). Underneath:
  * Disturbed earth, softened as if something tunneled or pressed up.
  * Faint green-black viscous residue in the soil.
  * A root- or tendril-like growth that twitches when exposed to air
    and heat, then goes still. The siphoning sound stops.
- No full creature encountered; just the tendril and residue. No XP
  granted this session for combat (combat occurred in Session II).
- Discussion with Drett:
  * Drett is disturbed but remains functional.
  * He suggests possible people who might understand such things:
    - Merowin, an apothecary near Frostmere Row (herbalist with some
      "weirder" knowledge).
    - The Salvagers' Guild, who often expose old structures and scrap.
  * An earlier mistaken mention of Elden Ward is struck from canon:
    Drett does not know that name. (User caught this; DM corrected.)

Shed Two:
- The pair walk to the second shed.
- Borian inspects the outside and threshold (Perception 5+2 = 7). No
  obvious tracks, scrapes, or damage; snow appears undisturbed.
- Drett unlocks and opens the door. Inside:
  * A clear, unnatural frost rime on surfaces.
  * Frost is heaviest toward the back-left corner, thinning toward the
    door in a fan-like pattern.
  * Two grain sacks along the left wall sag oddly as if moisture has
    been pulled or frozen away.
  * A faint, steady draft of very cold air rises from between the
    floorboards.
  * Borian, listening carefully from the threshold (Perception 20+2
    earlier for this shed's interior scan), hears a very faint
    crackling, like ice forming in a confined space below.
- No creatures appear. No boards are lifted here.
- Borian decides not to enter. He closes and locks the shed again at
  Drett's request. They agree the phenomenon is not natural frost.

Shed Three:
- The third shed is older, with a newer lock but weathered boards.
- Inside inspection:
  * Borian steps in and looks around (Perception 2+2 = 4). He notices
    the obvious: a slight upward bulge in the far-right corner of the
    floor. No scent of decay, no frost, no residue visible.
  * Dust is present, but with this low roll the finer dust patterns are
    not discerned in detail.
- Borian attempts to pry the bowed board alone (Athletics 5+5 = 10).
  The board creaks but does not come free.
- He calls Drett to assist. On a coordinated heave (Athletics 16+5 =
  21), the board tears loose; nails rip out with a loud crack.
- Beneath the boards:
  * The earth has collapsed downward in a shallow basin, as if
    something large moved beneath recently.
  * At the center is a curved, dark, smooth surface: not earth, wood,
    or metal, but worked stone.
  * The exposed arc bears geometric carvings:
    - Concentric arcs.
    - Three precise intersecting notches.
    - A narrow recessed groove that continues deeper into the soil.
  * On closer examination (Investigation 20-1 = 19), Borian recognizes
    the pattern as functional, not decorative—akin to dwarven
    geometric notation used for mechanisms and structures. There is a
    triangular sigil with a broken apex.
  * Faint traces of the same green-black residue seen in Shed One mark
    the carved groove, indicating something passed this point and
    touched the stone recently.
- Interpretation (DM-side, not spoken aloud):
  * This segment of stone is part of a larger constructed form beneath
    the granary—likely a chamber wall or conduit ceiling.
  * The upward pressure that bowed the board came from the stone
    itself shifting or from something beneath it pressing upward.

Resolution with Drett:
- Borian advises Drett not to call the Salvagers' Guild yet, warning
  that they would turn the whole lane into a dig site and possibly make
  things worse.
- Drett agrees to:
  * Lock all three sheds.
  * Keep quiet about the disturbances.
  * Wait for Borian to seek expert help (e.g., Merowin).
- Drett closes and locks each shed in turn. This is a clear, explicit
  agreement that no one else will be brought in without Borian's say.
- Before Borian leaves:
  * He presents the rat-clearance notice from earlier.
  * Drett signs with his name and role and notes that:
    - The infestation is cleared.
    - Structures have been checked.
    - Work is complete.
  * Drett offers Borian a small packet of dried hearthfruit as a
    personal token of thanks (extra reward beyond the contract rate).
  * Borian offers a short blessing/prayer for Drett, asking that
    generosity and honesty mark him. Drett accepts this respectfully.

Scene 2 – Hall of Free Companies (Rat Contract & Job Board)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Rat Contract:
- Borian travels back up to the Hall.
- The city is fully awake by now; this is mid-to-late morning, not an
  "early riser" period. (Continuity corrected explicitly in chat.)
- At the counter:
  * Borian turns in Drett's signed rat notice.
  * The clerk initially mis-pays only 3 silver.
  * Borian points out the posted job rate of 5 silver.
  * The clerk confirms, apologizes, and adds 2 more silver for the
    correct total of 5 sp.
  * The slip is stamped as completed and archived.

Job Board – Contracts Actually Seen and Described:
- Borian then examines the notice board for changes and available work
  (Perception 10+2 = 12).
- Board state from this session:
  * Rat contract: removed from play; marked as completed.
  * Dockside Mediation – Wharf Dispute:
    - Location: Wharf 3B.
    - Dispute between crews of trawler North Star and longboat Grey
      Gull over drift lines, damaged nets, and alleged boundary
      violations.
    - Reward: approx. 10–12 silver, payment from both captains.
    - Notes: Specifically requests a neutral mediator not tied to
      either crew.
  * Frost-Kiln Firewatch – Night Shift:
    - Location: Frost-Kiln workshop.
    - Task: Night watch due to a recent attempted break-in.
    - Reward: 20 silver.
    - Timing: One night shift, "tonight".
    - Status this session: Slip taken by Borian, but job not yet
      begun or completed.
  * Missing Fisher – Joren Vale:
    - Posting predates session; updated at ninth bell with witness
      sighting near the lower quays and a note of possible injury.
    - Reward listed as 15 silver.
    - Not pursued this session.
  * Eastlane Caravan Guard Prep:
    - One-shift non-travel guard/escort preparation for a caravan.
    - Reward: 8 silver.
    - Not pursued this session.
  * Temple Repair – Shrine of the Tidemother:
    - One-day contract to assist with storm damage repairs.
    - Reward: 6 silver and offer of a blessing.
    - Not pursued this session.
  * Lost Parcel – South Row:
    - Palm-length wooden box gone missing, suspected stolen.
    - Reward: 5 silver.
    - Not pursued this session.
  * Salvagers' Guild Reserved Slot:
    - A notice space held with a wax seal for the Salvagers' Guild,
      but no text yet posted.
- After confirming nobody is paying special attention to him (Perception
  19+2 = 21), Borian attempts to take both:
  * Dockside Mediation slip.
  * Frost-Kiln Firewatch slip.
- Sleight of Hand 1+1 = 2:
  * The Frost-Kiln slip tears slightly and makes a soft sound.
  * The clerk glances up, notices only that "something came off the
    board", shrugs, and returns to his work.
  * Mechanical result: Borian successfully takes both slips. Only the
    clerk has a vague awareness that a posting was removed; no one else
    tracks him or the slips.

Scene 3 – Wharf 3B Mediation (North Star vs Grey Gull)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Arrival:
- Borian travels from the Hall down to Wharf 3B.
- He finds two crews facing off:
  * North Star: Heavier-booted, older crew; Captain Halla.
  * Grey Gull: Lighter, younger crew; Captain Marrek.
- The argument is loudly escalating over damaged nets and alleged line
  violations.
- A nearby dockhand explains what he saw:
  * North Star had inside line, Grey Gull outer.
  * Sudden wind gust and channel current likely pushed Grey Gull's
    lighter hull.
  * Nets tangled fast; he could not clearly see which boat drifted
    first.
  * He believes there was no deliberate malice, just bad luck and
    pride.

Establishing Authority:
- Borian raises the Hall slip and calls out, asking if someone requested
  a neutral party.
- Both captains confirm they did and recognize the mediator role.
- Borian lays out terms:
  * He has no allegiance to either crew.
  * Both captains agree to be bound by his judgment.
  * No further retribution or ill-will is to be carried between crews.
  * If they are unhappy with the decision, their grievance is with him,
    not each other.
- Both captains accept these terms explicitly.

Order of Testimony:
- Borian uses a dragonchess piece as a draw. Halla chooses "dark".
- The piece in Borian's hand is light.
- Borian then asks Captain Marrek, as the "light" selection, whether he
  chooses to speak first or defer.
- Marrek chooses to speak first.

Private Interview – Captain Marrek:
- Insight check 19+2 = 21:
  * Marrek is sincere: no malice, no attempt to sabotage.
  * He is worried about coin and reputation but trying to be honest.
- Marrek's account:
  * A sudden wind and tricky channel current pushed his lighter hull
    into Halla's drift line.
  * Nets tangled; his crew began cutting to avoid dangerous entrapment.
  * One of Halla's nets was ruined beyond simple repair; another may be
    salvageable.
  * He is willing to pay fair compensation but fears public humiliation
    and being seen as weak.
  * He estimates a fair magistrate's decision would total around 12–15
    silver in damages (full for one net, partial for the other, plus
    time lost).
  * He can pay a few silver immediately, with the rest over the next
    runs, but cannot pay the full amount at once without hurting his
    crew.
  * He insists he would not endanger Halla's crew or steal her catch.
- He acknowledges that if drift is formally his responsibility, he must
  pay something, but does not want the judgment twisted into a long-term
  advantage for Halla.

Private Interview – Captain Halla:
- Insight check 9+2 = 11:
  * Borian can tell she believes what she says, but some nuance may be
    hidden under discipline and pride.
- Halla's account:
  * She set her nets where she always does.
  * The channel in that area is known to have tricky currents.
  * Wind and current together likely played a role, but in her view
    Marrek runs too close, making drift inevitable.
  * When the nets tangled, her crew hauled hard to save the line; his
    crew cut fast.
  * One of her nets shows a clean tear along the seam, which she sees
    as evidence of overly aggressive cutting rather than careful
    clearance.
  * She does not claim sabotage, but she does see recklessness.
  * She believes a magistrate would split responsibility—acknowledging
    Marrek's drift as primary cause, but also noting that her crew's
    reaction contributed to the damage.
  * She wants the nets replaced and her crew's lost morning accounted
    for, but does not seek to ruin Marrek.

Joint Judgment and Public Resolution:
- Borian calls both captains back together and has their crews assemble
  to witness the settlement.
- He frames his ruling:
  * Acknowledges the hardships of sea life and the primary duty of a
    captain to their crew's safety.
  * States that tempers rose not from hatred but from fierce
    responsibility.
  * Affirms that no malice or neglect was found in Marrek's actions,
    but that his drift and his crew's cutting did cause real damage and
    lost earnings.
- Specific terms Borian sets (explicit, at-table):
  * Captain Marrek is liable for:
    - 8 silver for the ruined net.
    - 1 silver for the lost morning.
    - Total: 9 silver.
  * Marrek will provide Captain Halla with one fully serviceable net.
  * In exchange, Halla will give Marrek the damaged net, which his crew
    can attempt to repair.
  * Marrek will pay:
    - 2 silver immediately.
    - The remaining 7 silver over the next three runs at most, with no
      interest.
- Both captains agree to these terms.
- In front of both crews:
  * Borian delivers a short speech stressing that lives saved matter
    more than damaged nets, that tempers should not harden into
    permanent feuds, and that they are "brothers and sisters at sea"
    who may share the same deck one day.
  * He orders them, in effect, back to their work: "Get back to those
    riggings."
- The captains:
  * Shake hands publicly.
  * Exchange nets as agreed.
  * Marrek pays 2 silver on the spot.
- Result:
  * Crews stand down; shouting ends.
  * Tidewardens on a nearby quay witness the resolution but do not
    intervene.
  * No ongoing hostility is evident at session end.

Documentation:
- Borian remembers to get the mediation notice signed.
- Captain Halla signs first, with her name and title, marking the
  dispute as resolved and terms accepted.
- Captain Marrek signs after, acknowledging the agreed repayment.
- The signed slip is now in Borian's possession and later turned in at
  the Hall.

Scene 4 – Hall of Free Companies (Mediation Payment)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Borian returns to the Hall and presents the signed mediation notice.
- The same clerk processes it:
  * Reviews both signatures and terms.
  * Notes that the dispute was resolved peacefully and formally.
  * Pays Borian 12 silver for the completed mediation contract.
- This 12 silver is the only payment from the Hall for this contract.
  (No bonuses beyond the posted range.)

Scene 5 – Anchorfall Inn and Long Rest
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Borian returns to the Anchorfall Inn.
- Torven observes his bruised, exhausted state and seats him near the
  hearth.
- Torven brings:
  * A bowl of fish-and-barley stew.
  * Warm bread.
  * A small cup of herbal drink/tonic.
- Torven insists the meal is on the house given Borian's condition.
- Borian eats and warms himself, then thanks Torven and heads to his
  room, promising to share details later.
- In his room:
  * Borian removes gear and settles onto the bed.
  * He enters a four-hour elven trance.
  * This counts as a long rest for Borian.
- By the time the trance ends, it is early evening (around the tenth
  bell). The inn is active with the early evening crowd. We end the
  session here, with Borian recovered.

MECHANICAL / STATE UPDATES
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

XP This Session:
- No new combat XP (rat combat was in Session II).
- 200 XP total this session:
  * 100 XP – multi-shed investigation and meaningful discovery of the
    ancient structure and anomalies beneath the granary.
  * 100 XP – dockside mediation (complex social encounter) resolved
    cleanly and bindingly with both captains' cooperation.

Currency Changes (Session III only):
- +5 silver – rat contract payment (Hall, corrected from 3 to 5).
- +12 silver – mediation payment (Hall).
- 0 expense for meal at Anchorfall (Torven comped).
- Net session gain: +17 silver.

Items and Contracts:
- New tangible item:
  * Small packet of dried hearthfruit from Drett.
- Contracts:
  * Rat contract – completed and closed in this session.
  * Dockside mediation – completed and closed in this session.
  * Frost-Kiln firewatch – slip taken; work not yet begun by session
    end (night shift still ahead).

Allies / Relationships:
- Drett (Foreman, West Granary):
  * Grateful, discreet.
  * Has agreed to keep the shed disturbances secret and the sheds
    locked until Borian advises otherwise.
- Captain Halla (North Star):
  * Respects Borian's fairness and authority.
  * No active grudge toward Marrek after the settlement.
- Captain Marrek (Grey Gull):
  * Relieved and grateful for a fair judgment.
  * Bound by honor and reputation to fulfill the 7 silver repayment
    over his next runs.

HIDDEN DM THREADS (NOT FOR CODEX)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Granary understructure:
  * The carved stone beneath Shed Three is part of an older, hidden
    system under Varengate—likely dwarven or dwarf-taught origin.
  * The green-black residue and the tendril-like growths represent an
    intrusive or leaking phenomenon from below. Its exact nature is
    undecided but should remain consistent with prior residue behavior.
- Frost and Cold:
  * Shed Two's radiating cold is a distinct but related manifestation,
    indicating multiple "points of pressure" from the deeper structure
    or environment beneath the city.
- Frost-Kiln Contract:
  * Outstanding contract that could intersect with undercity or criminal
    activity, depending on future session choices. No events tied to it
    occurred this session.
- Missing Fisher – Joren Vale:
  * Updated posting is on the board. No action taken this session.
    Remains as a potential future hook.

SESSION END STATE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Location: Anchorfall Inn, Borian's room, immediately after completing
  a four-hour trance (long rest).
- Time: Early evening (approx. tenth bell).
- Condition: Fully recovered from earlier wounds; no active conditions.
- Outstanding hooks:
  * Frost-Kiln firewatch contract for "tonight".
  * Granary understructure anomalies (three sheds).
