TIMEFRAME
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Day 2 in Varengate, predawn through early morning. Borian wakes from
his trance around the third bell, walks the harbor before dawn, climbs
to the high ridge as the city stirs, and reaches the western granary
shortly after first light.

WEATHER / ATMOSPHERE

Late-winter cold with light snow and lingering sleet crust on roofs
and streets. Harbor air wet and briny, with low cloud and patchy fog
over the water.

SESSION SUMMARY (HIGH LEVEL)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Borian spends the quiet predawn hours at Anchorfall and in the
  harbor streets.
- He encounters Rulfen near the Drowned Lantern and learns of missing
  guild drops.
- At a Tidemother shrine he comforts an elderly mother and learns the
  name Joren, then heals a dockhand with Lay on Hands.
- He climbs to the civic notice board, taking a rat-clearing contract
  and noting a missing fisherman posting.
- At the western granary he meets Drett, fights two giant rats, and
  discovers that the threat is not ordinary vermin.
- He identifies a subtle magical seep at the far wall and prepares to
  investigate neighboring spaces.

DETAILED CONTINUITY – SCENE BY SCENE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Scene 1 – Quiet Hours at Anchorfall
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Borian wakes from his elven trance around the third bell and quietly
  checks the hallway (Perception 21). No threats, only a sleeping inn.
- He descends to the common room where Torven is already at work on
  the morning’s prep. They share quiet conversation over tea and
  toast.
- Borian asks after Elden Ward, mentioning Sereth’s intention to put
  in a word for him. Torven confirms Elden often comes by in the
  evenings and agrees to keep an eye out, giving Borian a clear path
  to honest work.
- Anchorfall’s status as a safe haven is reaffirmed; Torven continues
  to see Borian as a polite but capable outsider.

Scene 2 – The Drowned Lantern Alley and Rulfen
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Borian heads toward the harbor, using the early hour to learn the
  streets around Frostmere Row and the waterfront.
- A light fall of snow and sleet reveals tracks: narrow-heeled,
  pointed-toe prints that stand out from the heavier laborers’ boots,
  leading into a side alley near the Drowned Lantern stretch of the
  docks.
- In the alley he notes a moved crate and a small broken metal clasp
  or nail near where a lock might have been fixed. The scene suggests
  a disturbed drop or tampered stash.
- Sensing he is not alone, Borian uses Prestidigitation to create a
  creaking “above” sound and a gust-like sensation meant to make the
  hidden watcher flinch, then slips out of the alley mouth to avoid
  being cornered.
- A man with a crossbow, Rulfen, approaches along the street rather
  than from the alley. He is cautious but professional, clearly not
  common guard nor random thug.
- Rulfen reveals he is an independent troubleshooter hired by a local
  guild to watch "drops" in the Drowned Lantern area that have been
  going missing. He presses gently on whether Borian is involved.
- Borian offers a partial read of the scene: the unusual footwear, the
  disturbed crate, and the broken clasp. He makes it clear he was
  curious, not complicit, and prefers to see a threat head-on rather
  than risk a knife in the back.
- He deduces aloud that hiring an outsider suggests the guild either
  lacks internal capacity or wants to keep this quiet from its own
  people. This lands with Rulfen, who neither confirms nor denies but
  notes the insight.
- Borian declines immediate entanglement but leaves a line open:
  Rulfen can contact him at the Anchorfall Inn via Torven if another
  pair of hands is needed. He tosses Rulfen the broken clasp fragment
  before departing.
- DM note: Rulfen is a competent, observant operator with a quiet
  moral floor. He tags Borian as cautious, perceptive, and not easily
  pushed into opaque work.

Scene 3 – Shrines, Names, and Lay on Hands
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Continuing along the harbor, Borian notices a small, weathered
  shrine to the Tidemother at the end of a pier, tended by local
  families. An elderly woman kneels there, clearly anxious.
- A History check (12) recalls that such shrines are common in
  Varengate for sailors and fishers; they are more household-devotional
  than formal temple.
- Borian kneels beside her, asks gently about her concern, and learns
  that her son, Joren, has gone to sea and has not yet returned. She
  fears the unpredictable northern waters.
- He takes her hands and offers a full voiced prayer to the Tidemother
  for Joren’s safe passage and for those who wait on the shore, tying
  seafaring danger to the quiet endurance of families left behind.
- The woman, moved, presses two silver pieces on him. Borian insists
  he needs no payment but ultimately accepts only one, subtly slipping
  a coin back into her hand and closing her fingers around it, saying
  he will "pay it forward" for others.
- She departs comforted; Borian leaves with +1 sp and the name "Joren"
  pinned to a growing mental map of Varengate’s people.
- Later along the docks, Borian notices a young dockhand with a rope-
  burned and cut hand. He offers to take a look.
- A clumsy initial medical inspection (Medicine 1) does little on its
  own, but Borian follows with Lay on Hands, spending 1 point from his
  pool to close the wound and restore the young man’s strength.
- The dockhand returns to work with renewed vigor and a story about
  the quiet elf who fixed his hand in a heartbeat.
- DM note: This is the campaign’s first in-world use of Lay on Hands.
  Counts as 1 training/faith scene for any future devotion or divine
  focus tracking.

Scene 4 – The High Ridge and the Notice Board
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Borian climbs the East Lane switchbacks from the harbor toward the
  high ridge, taking care to learn the switchback path and sight-lines
  over the city.
- At the top he finds a civic cluster: modest stone buildings, a pair
  of mercenaries on informal watch, and a well-used notice board.
- The board carries various posts; two stand out:
  - A rat-clearing job at the western granary, posted by Drett.
  - A notice about a missing fisherman, likely Joren or closely
    related to his situation.
- When Borian asks whether the contracts are "free for the taking" or
  require registration, the mercenaries confirm he simply tears the
  slip and then presents himself to the named contact.
- Borian chooses the rat job as a likely quick win to establish
  reputation and coin. He intentionally leaves the missing fisherman
  notice in place for now but mentally tags it for a future return.
- DM note: The missing-fisher notice is indeed linked to Joren. This
  is a seeded follow-on thread rather than an obligation.

Scene 5 – Drett’s Granary and the Rat Fight
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- At the western granary Borian meets Drett, an overworked but
  practical foreman worried about spoiled grain and unnerving noise
  from below.
- Drett explains that rats have always existed, but recently they seem
  bolder, appearing at odd hours and gnawing near the outer wall.
- Borian asks about light and access. Drett provides a hooded lantern
  and, eventually, a ring of keys to internal storage spaces.
- At the hatch leading down into the basement, Borian lights the
  lantern but leaves it above the hatch, relying on his darkvision to
  scout first.
- From the top he sees two oversized rats moving among scattered
  sacks. Along the far earth wall, the ground looks disturbed, as if a
  burrow or something similar has been pushed up recently.
- Borian casts Shield of Faith, boosting his armor, then drops to the
  basement floor with sword drawn and advances.
- Combat unfolds against two giant rats:
  - Borian uses Prestidigitation to throw a shower of sparks as he
    lunges, rattling the vermin.
  - He cuts down the first rat with heavy slashing damage.
  - The second rat, larger and subtly wrong, bites through his
    defenses once despite his raised AC.
  - Borian responds with disciplined follow-up blows, finally killing
    the larger rat. The brief fight underscores that these are not
    ordinary cellar pests.
- After combat, he uses Lay on Hands on himself, spending 4 points to
  restore his health to full. His Lay on Hands pool is now fully
  expended for the day.
- DM note: Combat difficulty was on the light side but framed as a
  solo, low-level encounter tailored to match CR 1/8 creatures with
  environmental tension.

Scene 6 – The Wall That Hums
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- With the immediate threat ended, Borian sweeps the basement for more
  rats (Perception 16). No further movement, but the far earth wall
  near the disturbed ground feels subtly "wrong" to him.
- He returns upstairs, retrieves the lantern properly, and invites
  Drett to see. The foreman reluctantly joins him with a second light.
- Back at the wall, Borian conducts a closer look in full light and
  uses his senses for anything beyond the mundane.
- An Arcana check (13) reveals a faint, upward seep of magical
  influence from below. It is not an active spell or glyph, but the
  ground feels like it has been "touched" by something that left a
  residue. There is a barely-perceptible humming in his bones and a
  chill that is not simply the cellar draft.
- Borian questions Drett about tunnels, old foundations, or adjoining
  cellars. Drett explains that many warehouses and granaries in this
  part of the city once had interconnected storage tunnels; most have
  been sealed or allowed to fall into disuse, but some spaces remain
  accessible or simply forgotten.
- Nearest buildings include other storage houses, empty or lightly
  used, and a guild storehouse across the street.
- Borian advises Drett to move grain away from the suspect wall and to
  raise as much as possible off the floor until the source is
  understood. Drett, worried and grateful, pulls out a ring of keys so
  Borian can inspect neighboring storage spaces.
- The session ends with Borian and Drett in the alley behind the
  granary standing at the door of the shed ready to investigate what
  lies beyond.

ALLIES / RELATIONSHIPS CHANGES
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Torven (Anchorfall Inn): Positive; sees Borian as reliable and
  respectful; willing to pass messages (including from Elden Ward).
- Sereth (Teahouse): Friendly; prior promise to mention Borian to
  Elden Ward still pending.
- Rulfen (independent troubleshooter): Neutral-Professional; intrigued
  by Borian’s caution and insight; knows Borian’s inn and is willing
  to hire or involve him if the situation escalates.
- Drett (western granary foreman): Positive; indebted for rat
  clearance and advice; trusts Borian with keys to adjacent spaces.
- Elderly harbor mother: Grateful; views Borian as a quiet holy man
  tied to the Tidemother’s mercy.
- Young dockhand: Grateful; informal goodwill and word-of-mouth in
  the harbor worker community.

ITEMS / CONTRACTS CHANGES
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- +1 sp – Gift from the elderly woman at the Tidemother shrine.
- Rat-clearing contract at western granary: taken, not yet paid out.
- No tracked expenses beyond minor food covered in prior lifestyle
  accounting.

HIDDEN DM THREADS (NOT FOR CODEX)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Drowned Lantern Drops:
  A guild uses the Drowned Lantern stretch of the harbor for covert
  dead-drops. Someone has begun interfering with those drops, leaving
  disturbed crates, missing items, and small broken hardware like the
  clasp Borian found. Rulfen’s employment indicates the guild does not
  trust its own people or the Tideguard to solve this quietly.

- Missing Fisherman – "Joren":
  The shrine scene and the missing-fisherman notice on the high-ridge
  board refer to the same situation. Joren is overdue. This may lead
  to a future contract involving sea hazards, smuggling routes, or
  something stranger in the coastal waters. Emotional hook: Borian has
  prayed for this specific name.

- Granary Seep and Undercity:
  The rats and disturbed earth are symptoms of a deeper phenomenon.
  There is an undercity or tunnel network beneath this block, and
  something magical or eldritch is bleeding upward through the soil.
  The nature of the seep may tie into regional ley disturbances or a
  local entity lairing below.

- Harbor-Guild and Civic Tension:
  The existence of independent troubleshooters like Rulfen and posted
  jobs at civic boards points to a balance of power between guilds,
  city officials, and the Tideguard. Varengate prefers problems to be
  handled off the books when possible. Borian’s choices may pull him
  toward one faction’s orbit.

- Faith and the Tidemother:
  Household-level devotion to the Tidemother reflects Varengate’s
  culture. Borian’s public prayer and results at the shrine deepen his
  reputation as a spiritually grounded outsider. This may open doors
  with small folk, fishers, and some minor clergy or wardens.

- Rules & Mechanics Reminders:
  - Concentration: When Borian takes damage while maintaining spells
    like Shield of Faith, prompt for Constitution saves to maintain
    concentration.
  - Resource Logging: Track Lay on Hands, spell slots, and similar
    features session-by-session for continuity.

- Style & Lore Notes:
  - Maintain Varengate’s feel as a hard, salt-bitten city where small
    kindnesses matter and secrets are tucked under everyday commerce.
  - Keep Rulfen competent and wary rather than melodramatic. He is a
    grounded point of contact in the Drowned Lantern thread.
  - The Tidemother is a local harbor spirit with overlapping aspects
    of older sea deities; keep references consistent.
  - The undercity beneath Varengate should feel old, layered, and
    built atop earlier structures, not a single uniform tunnel network.
