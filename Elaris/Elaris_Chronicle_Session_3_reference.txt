- Anchorfall Inn (common room and Borian's room).

SESSION SUMMARY (HIGH LEVEL)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Borian, still wounded from the rat fight earlier that morning (Session
II), assists Drett in examining three sheds behind the western granary.
Each shows a different sign of disturbance rising from below the city,
culminating in the discovery of carved stonework under the third shed.

Afterward, Borian:
- Turns in the rat-clearance slip at the Hall and is paid 5 silver.
- Quietly takes two contracts from the board:
  * Dockside mediation at Wharf 3B (completed this session).
  * Frost-Kiln firewatch night shift (taken, not yet fulfilled).
- Travels to Wharf 3B and resolves a near-brawl between two fishing
  crews via formal mediation.
- Is paid 12 silver at the Hall for the mediation.
- Returns to Anchorfall, eats, and takes a four-hour elven trance,
  recovering from his earlier injuries.

DETAILED CONTINUITY – SCENE BY SCENE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Scene 1 – Western Granary Sheds (with Drett)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Context:
- This picks up immediately after the rat fight and cellar work from
  Session II. Borian is still bruised and bitten, but mobile.
- Drett has asked Borian to check the sheds because of "strange noises"
  and structural concerns.

Shed One:
- Borian listens at the door (Perception 16+2). He hears a slow,
  unpleasant siphoning sound and catches a faint acrid, chemical smell.
- He opens the door and observes from the threshold: ordinary storage
  contents (rope, crates, grain sacks) but an off smell and the sense
  of something underneath the floor near the back-left corner.
- He steps in cautiously, testing the boards. There is a slightly soft
  spot and subtle give near that corner.
- After moving a crate with Drett's help, Borian exposes a hairline
  crack between floorboards and a dark, damp stain.
- Borian pries up the board (Athletics 16+5 = 21). Underneath:
  * Disturbed earth, softened as if something tunneled or pressed up.
  * Faint green-black viscous residue in the soil.
  * A root- or tendril-like growth that twitches when exposed to air
    and heat, then goes still. The siphoning sound stops.
- No full creature encountered; just the tendril and residue. No XP
  granted this session for combat (combat occurred in Session II).
- Discussion with Drett:
  * Drett is disturbed but remains functional.
  * He suggests possible people who might understand such things:
    - Merowin, an apothecary near Frostmere Row (herbalist with some
      "weirder" knowledge).
    - The Salvagers' Guild, who often expose old structures and scrap.
  * An earlier mistaken mention of Elden Ward is struck from canon:
    Drett does not know that name. (User caught this; DM corrected.)

Shed Two:
- The pair walk to the second shed.
- Borian inspects the outside and threshold (Perception 5+2 = 7). No
  obvious tracks, scrapes, or damage; snow appears undisturbed.
- Drett unlocks and opens the door. Inside:
  * A clear, unnatural frost rime on surfaces.
  * Frost is heaviest toward the back-left corner, thinning toward the
    door in a fan-like pattern.
  * Two grain sacks along the left wall sag oddly as if moisture has
    been pulled or frozen away.
  * A faint, steady draft of very cold air rises from between the
    floorboards.
  * Borian, listening carefully from the threshold (Perception 20+2
    earlier for this shed's interior scan), hears a very faint
    crackling, like ice forming in a confined space below.
- No creatures appear. No boards are lifted here.
- Borian decides not to enter. He closes and locks the shed again at
  Drett's request. They agree the phenomenon is not natural frost.

Shed Three:
- The third shed is older, with a newer lock but weathered boards.
- Inside inspection:
  * Borian steps in and looks around (Perception 2+2 = 4). He notices
    the obvious: a slight upward bulge in the far-right corner of the
    floor. No scent of decay, no frost, no residue visible.
  * Dust is present, but with this low roll the finer dust patterns are
    not discerned in detail.
- Borian attempts to pry the bowed board alone (Athletics 5+5 = 10).
  The board creaks but does not come free.
- He calls Drett to assist. On a coordinated heave (Athletics 16+5 =
  21), the board tears loose; nails rip out with a loud crack.
- Beneath the boards:
  * The earth has collapsed downward in a shallow basin, as if
    something large moved beneath recently.
  * At the center is a curved, dark, smooth surface: not earth, wood,
    or metal, but worked stone.
  * The exposed arc bears geometric carvings:
    - Concentric arcs.
    - Three precise intersecting notches.
    - A narrow recessed groove that continues deeper into the soil.
  * On closer examination (Investigation 20-1 = 19), Borian recognizes
    the pattern as functional, not decorative—akin to dwarven
    geometric notation used for mechanisms and structures. There is a
    triangular sigil with a broken apex.
  * Faint traces of the same green-black residue seen in Shed One mark
    the carved groove, indicating something passed this point and
    touched the stone recently.
- Interpretation (DM-side, not spoken aloud):
  * This segment of stone is part of a larger constructed form beneath
    the granary—likely a chamber wall or conduit ceiling.
  * The upward pressure that bowed the board came from the stone
    itself shifting or from something beneath it pressing upward.

Resolution with Drett:
- Borian advises Drett not to call the Salvagers' Guild yet, warning
  that they would turn the whole lane into a dig site and possibly make
  things worse.
- Drett agrees to:
  * Lock all three sheds.
  * Keep quiet about the disturbances.
  * Wait for Borian to seek expert help (e.g., Merowin).
- Drett closes and locks each shed in turn. This is a clear, explicit
  agreement that no one else will be brought in without Borian's say.
- Before Borian leaves:
  * He presents the rat-clearance notice from earlier.
  * Drett signs with his name and role and notes that:
    - The infestation is cleared.
    - Structures have been checked.
    - Work is complete.
  * Drett offers Borian a small packet of dried hearthfruit as a
    personal token of thanks (extra reward beyond the contract rate).
  * Borian offers a short blessing/prayer for Drett, asking that
    generosity and honesty mark him. Drett accepts this respectfully.

Scene 2 – Hall of Free Companies (Rat Contract & Job Board)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Rat Contract:
- Borian travels back up to the Hall.
- The city is fully awake by now; this is mid-to-late morning, not an
  "early riser" period. (Continuity corrected explicitly in chat.)
- At the counter:
  * Borian turns in Drett's signed rat notice.
  * The clerk initially mis-pays only 3 silver.
  * Borian points out the posted job rate of 5 silver.
  * The clerk confirms, apologizes, and adds 2 more silver for the
    correct total of 5 sp.
  * The slip is stamped as completed and archived.

Job Board – Contracts Actually Seen and Described:
- Borian then examines the notice board for changes and available work
  (Perception 10+2 = 12).
- Board state from this session:
  * Rat contract: removed from play; marked as completed.
  * Dockside Mediation – Wharf Dispute:
    - Location: Wharf 3B.
    - Dispute between crews of trawler North Star and longboat Grey
      Gull over drift lines, damaged nets, and alleged boundary
      violations.
    - Reward: approx. 10–12 silver, payment from both captains.
    - Notes: Specifically requests a neutral mediator not tied to
      either crew.
  * Frost-Kiln Firewatch – Night Shift:
    - Location: Frost-Kiln workshop.
    - Task: Night watch due to a recent attempted break-in.
    - Reward: 20 silver.
    - Timing: One night shift, "tonight".
    - Status this session: Slip taken by Borian, but job not yet
      begun or completed.
  * Missing Fisher – Joren Vale:
    - Posting predates session; updated at ninth bell with witness
      sighting near the lower quays and a note of possible injury.
    - Reward listed as 15 silver.
    - Not pursued this session.
  * Eastlane Caravan Guard Prep:
    - One-shift non-travel guard/escort preparation for a caravan.
    - Reward: 8 silver.
    - Not pursued this session.
  * Temple Repair – Shrine of the Tidemother:
    - One-day contract to assist with storm damage repairs.
    - Reward: 6 silver and offer of a blessing.
    - Not pursued this session.
  * Lost Parcel – South Row:
    - Palm-length wooden box gone missing, suspected stolen.
    - Reward: 5 silver.
    - Not pursued this session.
  * Salvagers' Guild Reserved Slot:
    - A notice space held with a wax seal for the Salvagers' Guild,
      but no text yet posted.
- After confirming nobody is paying special attention to him (Perception
  19+2 = 21), Borian attempts to take both:
  * Dockside Mediation slip.
  * Frost-Kiln Firewatch slip.
- Sleight of Hand 1+1 = 2:
  * The Frost-Kiln slip tears slightly and makes a soft sound.
  * The clerk glances up, notices only that "something came off the
    board", shrugs, and returns to his work.
  * Mechanical result: Borian successfully takes both slips. Only the
    clerk has a vague awareness that a posting was removed; no one else
    tracks him or the slips.

Scene 3 – Wharf 3B Mediation (North Star vs Grey Gull)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Arrival:
- Borian travels from the Hall down to Wharf 3B.
- He finds two crews facing off:
  * North Star: Heavier-booted, older crew; Captain Halla.
  * Grey Gull: Lighter, younger crew; Captain Marrek.
- The argument is loudly escalating over damaged nets and alleged line
  violations.
- A nearby dockhand explains what he saw:
  * North Star had inside line, Grey Gull outer.
  * Sudden wind gust and channel current likely pushed Grey Gull's
    lighter hull.
  * Nets tangled fast; he could not clearly see which boat drifted
    first.
  * He believes there was no deliberate malice, just bad luck and
    pride.

Establishing Authority:
- Borian raises the Hall slip and calls out, asking if someone requested
  a neutral party.
- Both captains confirm they did and recognize the mediator role.
- Borian lays out terms:
  * He has no allegiance to either crew.
  * Both captains agree to be bound by his judgment.
  * No further retribution or ill-will is to be carried between crews.
  * If they are unhappy with the decision, their grievance is with him,
    not each other.
- Both captains accept these terms explicitly.

Order of Testimony:
- Borian uses a dragonchess piece as a draw. Halla chooses "dark".
- The piece in Borian's hand is light.
- Borian then asks Captain Marrek, as the "light" selection, whether he
  chooses to speak first or defer.
- Marrek chooses to speak first.

Private Interview – Captain Marrek:
- Insight check 19+2 = 21:
  * Marrek is sincere: no malice, no attempt to sabotage.
  * He is worried about coin and reputation but trying to be honest.
- Marrek's account:
  * A sudden wind and tricky channel current pushed his lighter hull
    into Halla's drift line.
  * Nets tangled; his crew began cutting to avoid dangerous entrapment.
  * One of Halla's nets was ruined beyond simple repair; another may be
    salvageable.
  * He is willing to pay fair compensation but fears public humiliation
    and being seen as weak.
  * He estimates a fair magistrate's decision would total around 12–15
    silver in damages (full for one net, partial for the other, plus
    time lost).
  * He can pay a few silver immediately, with the rest over the next
    runs, but cannot pay the full amount at once without hurting his
    crew.
  * He insists he would not endanger Halla's crew or steal her catch.
- He acknowledges that if drift is formally his responsibility, he must
  pay something, but does not want the judgment twisted into a long-term
  advantage for Halla.

Private Interview – Captain Halla:
- Insight check 9+2 = 11:
  * Borian can tell she believes what she says, but some nuance may be
    hidden under discipline and pride.
- Halla's account:
  * She set her nets where she always does.
  * The channel in that area is known to have tricky currents.
  * Wind and current together likely played a role, but in her view
    Marrek runs too close, making drift inevitable.
  * When the nets tangled, her crew hauled hard to save the line; his
    crew cut fast.
  * One of her nets shows a clean tear along the seam, which she sees
    as evidence of overly aggressive cutting rather than careful
    clearance.
  * She does not claim sabotage, but she does see recklessness.
  * She believes a magistrate would split responsibility—acknowledging
    Marrek's drift as primary cause, but also noting that her crew's
    reaction contributed to the damage.
  * She wants the nets replaced and her crew's lost morning accounted
    for, but does not seek to ruin Marrek.

Joint Judgment and Public Resolution:
- Borian calls both captains back together and has their crews assemble
  to witness the settlement.
- He frames his ruling:
  * Acknowledges the hardships of sea life and the primary duty of a
    captain to their crew's safety.
  * States that tempers rose not from hatred but from fierce
    responsibility.
  * Affirms that no malice or neglect was found in Marrek's actions,
    but that his drift and his crew's cutting did cause real damage and
    lost earnings.
- Specific terms Borian sets (explicit, at-table):
  * Captain Marrek is liable for:
    - 8 silver for the ruined net.
    - 1 silver for the lost morning.
    - Total: 9 silver.
  * Marrek will provide Captain Halla with one fully serviceable net.
  * In exchange, Halla will give Marrek the damaged net, which his crew
    can attempt to repair.
  * Marrek will pay:
    - 2 silver immediately.
    - The remaining 7 silver over the next three runs at most, with no
      interest.
- Both captains agree to these terms.
- In front of both crews:
  * Borian delivers a short speech stressing that lives saved matter
    more than damaged nets, that tempers should not harden into
    permanent feuds, and that they are "brothers and sisters at sea"
    who may share the same deck one day.
  * He orders them, in effect, back to their work: "Get back to those
    riggings."
- The captains:
  * Shake hands publicly.
  * Exchange nets as agreed.
  * Marrek pays 2 silver on the spot.
- Result:
  * Crews stand down; shouting ends.
  * Tidewardens on a nearby quay witness the resolution but do not
    intervene.
  * No ongoing hostility is evident at session end.

Documentation:
- Borian remembers to get the mediation notice signed.
- Captain Halla signs first, with her name and title, marking the
  dispute as resolved and terms accepted.
- Captain Marrek signs after, acknowledging the agreed repayment.
- The signed slip is now in Borian's possession and later turned in at
  the Hall.

Scene 4 – Hall of Free Companies (Mediation Payment)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Borian returns to the Hall and presents the signed mediation notice.
- The same clerk processes it:
  * Reviews both signatures and terms.
  * Notes that the dispute was resolved peacefully and formally.
  * Pays Borian 12 silver for the completed mediation contract.
- This 12 silver is the only payment from the Hall for this contract.
  (No bonuses beyond the posted range.)

Scene 5 – Anchorfall Inn and Long Rest
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Borian returns to the Anchorfall Inn.
- Torven observes his bruised, exhausted state and seats him near the
  hearth.
- Torven brings:
  * A bowl of fish-and-barley stew.
  * Warm bread.
  * A small cup of herbal drink/tonic.
- Torven insists the meal is on the house given Borian's condition.
- Borian eats and warms himself, then thanks Torven and heads to his
  room, promising to share details later.
- In his room:
  * Borian removes gear and settles onto the bed.
  * He enters a four-hour elven trance.
  * This counts as a long rest for Borian.
- By the time the trance ends, it is early evening (around the tenth
  bell). The inn is active with the early evening crowd. We end the
  session here, with Borian recovered.

MECHANICAL / STATE UPDATES
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
XP This Session:
- No new combat XP (rat combat was in Session II).
- 200 XP total this session:
  * 100 XP – multi-shed investigation and meaningful discovery of the
    ancient structure and anomalies beneath the granary.
  * 100 XP – dockside mediation (complex social encounter) resolved
    cleanly and bindingly with both captains' cooperation.

Currency Changes (Session III only):
- +5 silver – rat contract payment (Hall, corrected from 3 to 5).
- +12 silver – mediation payment (Hall).
- 0 expense for meal at Anchorfall (Torven comped).
- Net session gain: +17 silver.

Items and Contracts:
- New tangible item:
  * Small packet of dried hearthfruit from Drett.
- Contracts:
  * Rat contract – completed and closed in this session.
  * Dockside mediation – completed and closed in this session.
  * Frost-Kiln firewatch – slip taken; work not yet begun by session
    end (night shift still ahead).

Allies / Relationships:
- Drett (Foreman, West Granary):
  * Grateful, discreet.
  * Has agreed to keep the shed disturbances secret and the sheds
    locked until Borian advises otherwise.
- Captain Halla (North Star):
  * Respects Borian's fairness and authority.
  * No active grudge toward Marrek after the settlement.
- Captain Marrek (Grey Gull):
  * Relieved and grateful for a fair judgment.
  * Bound by honor and reputation to fulfill the 7 silver repayment
    over his next runs.

HIDDEN DM THREADS (NOT FOR CODEX)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Granary understructure:
  * The carved stone beneath Shed Three is part of an older, hidden
    system under Varengate—likely dwarven or dwarf-taught origin.
  * The green-black residue and the tendril-like growths represent an
    intrusive or leaking phenomenon from below. Its exact nature is
    undecided but should remain consistent with prior residue behavior.

- Frost and Cold:
  * Shed Two's radiating cold is a distinct but related manifestation,
    indicating multiple "points of pressure" from the deeper structure
    or environment beneath the city.

- Frost-Kiln Contract:
  * Outstanding contract that could intersect with undercity or
    criminal activity, depending on future session choices. No events
    tied to it occurred this session.

- Missing Fisher – Joren Vale:
  * Updated posting is on the board. No action taken this session.
    Remains as a potential future hook.

SESSION END STATE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Location: Anchorfall Inn, Borian's room, immediately after completing
  a four-hour trance (long rest).
- Time: Early evening (approx. tenth bell).
- Condition: Fully recovered from earlier wounds; no active conditions.
- Outstanding hooks:
  * Frost-Kiln firewatch contract for "tonight".
  * Granary understructure anomalies (three sheds).
  * Merowin the apothecary as a potential expert.
  * Missing fisher posting and other board jobs (unclaimed).
