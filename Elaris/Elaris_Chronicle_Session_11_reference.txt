WEATHER / ATMOSPHERE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Cold winter morning, clear air. The city functions normally on the
surface, but reports circulate among early workers of tools slipping,
cold pockets in enclosed spaces, and echoes arriving out of order.
No public alarm; subtle unease only.

LOCATIONS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Tidewarden Station B – Maintenance Annex (side entrance)
- Mid-tier maintenance corridors and spur
- Adjacent mid-tier streets
- Small bakery off main thoroughfare
- Southcross Tier – private laundry house
- Anchorfall Inn (private room, common room)
- Gildery Stacks (reading hall / lending desk)
- Frostmere Row routes between tiers

SESSION SUMMARY (HIGH LEVEL)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Investigated Tidewarden runner disappearance with Arlen Rusk at first
  light; identified boundary-adjacent behavior consistent with prior cases.
- Located runner Edrin within a non-visual adjacency zone; confirmed he was
  alive but disoriented and unable to self-extract.
- Engaged a hired street group led by Kerric attempting to recover or
  silence the runner; neutralized the threat without fatalities.
- Stabilized Kerric and turned him over alive to the Tideguard, preserving
  legal leverage and avoiding escalation.
- Extracted and concealed Edrin via controlled escort and silhouette
  management; established a temporary safe location.
- Returned borrowed lock text to the Gildery Stacks and withdrew to rest,
  preserving discretion and schedule discipline.

DETAILED CONTINUITY – SCENE BY SCENE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Scene 1 – Station B Annex: Briefing and Initial Assessment (Day 12)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Borian met Arlen Rusk at the maintenance annex before the harbor bells.
- Arlen confirmed a Tidewarden runner (Edrin) failed to return; staffing
  was thin due to the disappearance.
- Borian examined the runner’s recovered tools; noted the anomaly that
  items were returned when no such return occurred in Joren Vale’s case.
- Borian and Arlen aligned on a confirm-first approach, avoiding premature
  descent or public involvement.

Scene 2 – Mid-tier Corridors: Boundary Proximity (Day 12)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Borian and Arlen retraced the runner’s likely route through maintenance
  corridors and a spur.
- Borian detected non-visual adjacency indicators (pressure, misaligned
  spatial sense) without a visible entry seam.
- Marks were placed conservatively to track the boundary’s extent.
- Runner Edrin was located within the affected space, conscious but unable
  to reorient without external alignment.

Scene 3 – Street Confrontation: Kerric’s Group (Day 12)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- A group of hired men led by Kerric confronted Borian and Arlen, intent on
  reclaiming or silencing the runner.
- Borian initiated control with Command (“Flee”), followed by Channel
  Divinity (Nature’s Wrath), restraining multiple attackers.
- Combat proceeded under surprise conditions; Borian enforced correct
  initiative, save timing, and reaction windows.
- Kerric was rendered unconscious but alive; remaining attackers fled or
  surrendered when pressed.
- No civilians were harmed; the runner remained protected throughout.

Scene 4 – Post-Combat Decisions: Stabilization and Handoff (Day 12)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Borian stabilized Kerric using a healer’s kit and removed visible blood
  via prestidigitation to prevent claims of excessive force.
- Kerric was delivered alive to the Tideguard for formal custody.
- Statements were given; the matter transitioned from street incident to
  official case.

Scene 5 – Bakery Meeting: Immediate Containment (Day 12)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Borian, Arlen, and Edrin regrouped at a small bakery to speak privately.
- Determined that Edrin’s disappearance resulted from route manipulation
  and probabilistic pressure, not precise control of seam locations.
- Concluded Edrin was selected for reliability and low-profile routine,
  making his loss deniable.
- Decision made to conceal Edrin temporarily while Arlen monitored the
  Tideguard’s handling of Kerric.

Scene 6 – Southcross Escort: Silhouette Management (Day 12)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Borian exchanged clothing with Edrin to control outward appearance,
  presenting a single consistent figure to any observers.
- Borian escorted Edrin to his aunt’s laundry house in Southcross Tier.
- Entry was conducted without attracting attention; Edrin instructed to
  remain in place and await word from Borian or Arlen unless forced to move.

Scene 7 – Gildery Stacks: Procedural Return (Day 12)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Borian returned a previously borrowed lock mechanisms volume to the
  Gildery Stacks lending desk.
- The transaction was routine; no research or new information was sought.
- Borian departed without lingering.

Scene 8 – Anchorfall Inn: Trance and Reset (Day 12)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Borian returned to Anchorfall Inn and entered a four-hour trance.
- No anomaly contact or intrusion occurred during the trance.
- Borian emerged rested, alert, and on schedule for midday coordination.

ALLIES / RELATIONSHIPS CHANGES
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Arlen Rusk: Operational trust deepened; parallel lines of inquiry active
  (street vs. Tideguard).
- Edrin (runner): Recovered alive; now a protected witness and liability.
- Tideguard: Kerric in custody; official process initiated.

ITEMS / CONTRACTS CHANGES
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Items:
  - Healer’s kit: 1 use expended.
  - No items gained or lost otherwise.
- Contracts / Threads:
  - Tidewarden runner disappearance: operationally resolved; political
    ramifications pending.
  - Granary understructure disturbances: still open.
  - Anomaly observations (Aleron Vale): still open.
  - Mara Rhensyr coordination: unchanged.

HIDDEN DM THREADS (NOT FOR CODEX)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- The confrontation confirms that non-magical actors are attempting to
  weaponize probabilistic boundary behavior rather than control it.
- Kerric’s willingness to act implies a payer with sufficient reach to
  influence runners’ routes.
- Edrin’s survival introduces a time-limited witness whose safety will
  shape future moves by hostile parties.
