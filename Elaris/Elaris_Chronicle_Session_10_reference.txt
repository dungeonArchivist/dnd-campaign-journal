WEATHER / ATMOSPHERE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Cold winter air, mostly clear. The city remains functional and calm on
the surface, but conversation carries a faint edge: reports of cold stone,
odd echoes, and "unease" circulate without becoming public alarm.

LOCATIONS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Anchorfall Inn (private room, back room, common room, rear alley)
- Scriptorium Terrace (west buttress pocket)
- Mid-tier stair / arch crossing (public seam site)
- Tidewarden Station B (routine work; planned annex meeting)
- Hall of Free Companies (routine postings)
- Frostmere Row routes between tiers

SESSION SUMMARY (HIGH LEVEL)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Met Arlen Rusk privately at Anchorfall; verified intent and discipline.
- Coordinated with Mara Rhensyr and assessed a public mid-tier seam with
  discretion; withdrew without drawing attention.
- Experienced a trance-time anomaly: a mundane note appeared without
  physical entry and without detectable spellcraft; message implied
  "acknowledgment" and reiterated the eight-point upper bound.
- Returned to routine work and study for three days to preserve discretion;
  earned modest coin and advanced lock training.
- Arlen returned with a Tidewarden runner disappearance and proposed a
  confirm-first plan; meeting set for first light at Station B annex.

DETAILED CONTINUITY – SCENE BY SCENE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Scene 1 – Anchorfall Back Room: Arlen Rusk (Day 8)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Borian coordinated with Torven to use the back room for a discreet talk.
- Borian maintained exit control and tested the visitor's intent.
- Arlen Rusk identified himself as a quiet investigator with no uniform
  authority and stated he works in the interests of Varengate's people.
- Borian conducted an Insight check and judged Arlen competent and sincere;
  Arlen encouraged Borian to keep other commitments and did not demand
  secrecy or loyalty.
- Borian described the understructure as an overlapping/adjacent space that
  intrudes where open space should exist (boat floor / sea mismatch).
- Borian reported granary signs: gouge marks, metallic smell, greenish
  residue, and deformed rats (enlarged, patchy/scaly, swollen joints).
- Arlen framed these as boundary shear exposure, not ordinary magic.

Scene 2 – Scriptorium Terrace: Mara Rhensyr (Day 8)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Borian met Mara in the west buttress pocket and reported abstractly that
  another disciplined party is paying attention (no names given).
- Mara accepted the profile as not inherently hostile and prioritized
  discretion and calm.
- Mara directed Borian's attention to a subtle shimmer at a mid-tier arch.
- Borian confirmed he has only seen that shimmer at true entry seams (frost
  kiln; Shed Two; Joren's boat boundary) and never elsewhere.

Scene 3 – Mid-tier Arch: Seam Assessment and Withdrawal (Day 8)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Borian and Mara approached the arch as if evaluating masonry to avoid
  attracting attention.
- Borian assessed the seam as familiar but stronger and more defined than
  earlier early-stage seams; it did not respond to his presence.
- They withdrew calmly; no public crossings occurred and no alarm was raised.

Scene 4 – Evening Watch at Anchorfall (Day 8)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Borian remained visible and ordinary at Anchorfall while waiting for word.
- Late-night patrons spoke of cold stone and odd echoes; the unease was
  present but unnamed.

Scene 5 – Trance Adjacency and the Note (Night of Day 8)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Borian entered trance, remaining conscious (Trance canon enforced).
- A brief non-local pressure and coldness occurred; no one entered the room
  and no mundane intrusion was possible without Borian noticing.
- Borian searched for seam evidence (Perception 11): no visible shimmer or
  localized rift present.
- Detect Magic revealed no aura in the room and no aura on the note.
- The note was mundane parchment and ink; its appearance could not be
  explained by spellcraft. The message stated:
  - the mid-tier seam stabilized and receded with no public crossing,
  - Borian was "acknowledged" rather than tested,
  - eight remains an upper bound, and doors should not be sought yet.
- Borian secured the note and returned downstairs to listen and observe.

Scene 6 – Downtime Routine: Coin and Study (Days 9–11)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Borian kept a routine of small civic jobs (Hall postings; Station B help)
  and continued lock book study.
- Coin earned across Days 9–11: +24 sp (routine work, low risk).
- Lock training scenes logged: +3 (dedicated focus study and practice).

Scene 7 – Day 11 Contact: Arlen Returns (Late Afternoon)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Torven relayed that a disciplined man waited out back and used the phrase
  "still keeping the balance."
- Arlen reported a Tidewarden runner disappearance (Station B) with signs
  consistent with prior boundary events and claimed a location is known.
- Borian kept discussion abstract and did not reveal Mara or confirm
  personal seam observation; Arlen did not claim knowledge of Mara.
- Borian agreed to assist under a confirm-first plan; descent only if
  necessary. Meeting set for first light at Station B annex.

ALLIES / RELATIONSHIPS CHANGES
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Arlen Rusk: Working rapport; consent-based coordination.
- Mara Rhensyr: Discreet alignment; shared seam assessment.
- Torven: Trusted relay; maintained discretion without prying.
- Tidewarden Station B: Routine reliability reinforced.

ITEMS / CONTRACTS CHANGES
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Items:
  - Secured: anonymous planar note (mundane parchment/ink).
  - No other major items gained or lost.
- Contracts / Threads:
  - Continued: granary understructure disturbances.
  - Continued: unofficial anomaly observations (Aleron Vale).
  - Continued: Mara coordination (briefing line remains active).
  - New: Tidewarden runner disappearance (informal, via Arlen Rusk).

HIDDEN DM THREADS (NOT FOR CODEX)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- The note arrival demonstrates object transfer via adjacency without open
  seam and without spellcraft detectable by Detect Magic.
- The "acknowledgment" suggests the system tracks Borian's presence profile
  and deems it non-hostile at this stage.
- The public seam receding cleanly indicates pattern alignment rather than
  uncontrolled breach.
- Lock training remains short of the half proficiency threshold.

XP Total: 1895
