DETAILED CONTINUITY – SCENE BY SCENE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Scene 1 – Speaking with Sella Ward at the ropeworks
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Borian greets Sella Ward and receives clarification about Joren’s last
movements. Sella confirms Joren tied up the *Wish*, left his jacket on a
post, and walked toward Shed Two but did not stop to speak with anyone.
She describes him as generally friendly, making his silence unusual.
She does not know where the jacket ended up (likely taken by crew).

Sella’s account reinforces that Joren did not enter any visible shed
door. Her final detail: a cold draft near Shed Two’s rear wall caused
her to look up, but she saw nothing.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Scene 2 – Returning to Tannic and inspecting the *Mare’s Wish*
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Borian boards the vessel with Tannic. Topside inspection reveals no
signs of struggle. Below deck, Borian detects a cold emanation beneath
floorboards. Investigation reveals engineered stone beneath the decking,
seemingly stationary as the boat moves.

Pulling up a board reveals a glimpse of a stone tunnel—too smooth and
clean to be natural. They test whether movement of the vessel alters the
position; stone remains fixed, confirming it is independent of the boat.

No entryway beneath the ship; only solid engineered surface. The tunnel
is oriented parallel to the harbor but unreachable from the boat.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Scene 3 – Shed Two and discovery of the concealed access
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
At Shed Two, Borian notes a small gap near the rear wall emitting the
same cold felt earlier. He and Tannic pry boards from the back wall
(entry point, not flooring). Initial roll succeeds; subsequent heavy
board fails (natural 1), but combined effort with Guidance succeeds in
removing enough boards for entry.

Behind the shed wall is a narrow descending space. Dust suggests a
human-sized passage leading down. No signs of recent board replacement,
implying Joren did not enter through the wall as Borian did.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Scene 4 – Entering the engineered understructure
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
The descent opens into a chamber of worked stone: smooth surfaces,
soft ambient gray light, no debris. Temperature cold but stable.
Architecture shows no Varengate-era toolmarks.

Borian assesses walls for structural stability; they appear sound and
constructed with precision. He proceeds further, darkvision guiding him.
Tannic follows reluctantly.

A wood box is discovered containing a notebook and a crude map-sketch.
Borian inspects the book; the map displays unfamiliar corridors and
chambers, no obvious Varengate landmarks. Investigation roll (10–1) is
insufficient for precise orientation.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Scene 5 – Discovery of the multi-chamber system and the spire
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Borian determines the path ahead leads to another chamber. He and
Tannic advance cautiously. Borian’s Perception reveals a faint metal
object ahead. This proves to be a fishing hook—clear breadcrumb.

Map-sketched slot noted earlier is recalled; Borian suspects a puzzle
connection. A second breadcrumb (bobbin), then float, line, token,
cord, etc., confirms Joren’s passage.

A central chamber contains a tall spire-like structure of metal or
mineral composite with a small key-slot. Borian inspects it; markings
are geometric, repeating, likely part of a machine. Touching it causes
a perception-shift and spatial displacement: Borian reappears in the
initial chamber alone; Tannic is gone. No harm, no injury—just a lift-
like relocation.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Scene 6 – Following Joren’s breadcrumb trail deeper
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Borian re-enters the system alone. The breadcrumb trail is consistent:
small fishing tools placed carefully. Borian marks his own path with his
own items, creating a two-layer trail. Corridor geometry shifts subtly,
but not dangerously; Borian proceeds with caution.

Several chambers appear identical, but Borian notes dust patterns and
breadcrumb sequencing. Final breadcrumb is a knife lying near a right-
hand passage.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Scene 7 – The stasis chamber and Joren Vale
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
The knife leads to a large terminal chamber bathed in low pulsing gray
light. In the center: a smooth circular platform with faint channels.
Atop it sits Joren Vale in a still, seated posture. He is breathing,
uninjured, but unresponsive—held in a controlled stasis field.

Borian assesses: no physical wounds, no starvation markers, muscles not
atrophied. He identifies that the system is maintaining bodily
functions. Extraction is safe but requires manual lifting.

Borian lifts Joren; the chamber pulses once in reaction. The system
appears to accept the removal rather than resist it. Doorways and pulses
adjust but do not block exit.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Scene 8 – Ascent and Joren’s awakening
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Borian retraces breadcrumbs; the system remains passive. As distance
from the stasis chamber increases, Joren’s breathing deepens and traces
of consciousness return. By the time Borian reaches the shed, Joren is
responsive.

Once outside, fresh air accelerates recovery. Joren recognizes his own
name, environment, and crew context, but has limited memory of the
descent—he recalls a cold pull and stepping through a “door” that no one
else could see.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Scene 9 – Reunion at the ropeworks
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Borian accompanies Joren to the ropeworks. Tannic Orls is found seated
on a piling, staring at the tide. The reunion is immediate and
emotional. Tannic expresses profound trust and gratitude to Borian.
Joren confirms Borian saved his life but cannot describe the under-
structure coherently.

Crew members Rhett and Harren are informed; their initial shock matches
harbor gossip patterns.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Scene 10 – Reporting to Harbor Warden Aleron
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Borian reports Joren’s safe return and then outlines the strange
understructure in careful, high-level terms. Aleron maintains control,
asks precise questions, and immediately recognizes the implications.

Aleron confirms similarity to the frost kiln anomaly Borian previously
observed. He forbids alerting Hallwatch prematurely, citing risk of
panic and economic shutdown. He requests Borian’s discretion and
possible future assistance.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Scene 11 – Payment and closure
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
At the Hall’s clerk counter, Borian receives correct payout per Hall
policy:

- 10 gp for returning Joren alive
- +4 gp hazard bonus for understructure conditions
- +8 sp daily stipend

Total added: 14 gp, 8 sp.

The clerk formally closes the missing-person case.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Scene 12 – Anchorfall Inn and rest
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Borian returns to Anchorfall Inn. Torven provides a warm meal and
mulled cider. Borian rests, then enters trance. Day ends peacefully.

ALLIES / RELATIONSHIPS CHANGES
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Tannic Orls: Strong Positive (gratitude and trust)
- Joren Vale: Positive (rescued; views Borian as savior)
- Harbor Warden Aleron: Positive-Professional (confidence in discretion)
- Harborfront workers: Slight Positive (Joren’s return boosts standing)

ITEMS / CONTRACTS CHANGES
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Items Gained: Payment pouch (14 gp, 8 sp)
- Items Lost: none
- Contracts Closed: “Missing fisher – Joren Vale” (Completed)
- Contracts Open: “Granary understructure disturbances”

HIDDEN DM THREADS (NOT FOR CODEX)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- The understructure is part of a larger ancient system beneath
  Varengate. Each chamber is a node in a dormant network.
- The spire acts as a lift-anchor using attunement-by-contact and parses
  body heat signatures.
- Joren was held intentionally, not trapped accidentally; system
  recognized his presence as “processable.”
- The cold signature matches the frost kiln anomaly; both stem from the
  same subsurface strata.
- Shed Two anomaly is not isolated; additional nodes lie under other
  tiers, including one near Cooper’s Run.
- Aleron suspects ancient pre-Varengate infrastructure but lacks proof.
- The system is awakening gradually; Borian’s presence registers as a
  compatible profile.
