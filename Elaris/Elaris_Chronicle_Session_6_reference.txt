Approximate clock:
- ~09:00–10:00: Anchorfall Inn (parcel delivery and morning departure).
- ~10:00–11:00: Hall of Free Companies (board, escort job, postings).
- ~11:00–13:00: Cooper's Run clear-out and report.

- ~14:00–15:30: Hall return, missing-fisher contract, Slip 12 survey,
  dockhand interview, Drowned Lantern conversation with Tannic Orls.

WEATHER / ATMOSPHERE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Cold winter day, air clearer than prior stormy sessions. Breeze moving
steadily off the water, sharper and salt-heavy at the harborfront. Mid-
tier is busy but not frantic; harborfront has the usual mix of gulls,
tar, brine, and fish offal. Light is bright enough to throw long shadows
along quay and shed rows, but not yet into evening-gloom.

LOCATIONS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Anchorfall Inn – Room 3, common room.
- Hall of Free Companies – clerk counter, job board.
- Cooper's Run – drainage run beneath city, structural breach area.
- Mid-Tier Crossing – Marwen of Lowridge's herbal stall.
- Harborfront Tier – South Quay, Slip 12 (*Mare's Wish*).
- Dockside work area – Slip 13 hull-scraping site.
- The Drowned Lantern – harborfront tavern, Tannic's corner table.

SESSION SUMMARY (HIGH LEVEL)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Session VI advances the civic side of Varengate: Borian completes a
structural-clearance job at Cooper's Run, earns trust from city workers
and Marwen the herbalist, and then deliberately takes on the long-
ignored missing-fisher contract for Joren Vale. At South Quay he learns
the hard core of the mystery: Joren took the *Mare's Wish* out alone,
returned her neatly moored with gear stowed, then walked toward the old
harbor sheds and never reappeared. In the Drowned Lantern, Borian
secures Tannic Orls' trust and formal permission to board the vessel,
establishes the emotional and reputational stakes of the case, and
identifies two key next steps: speaking with net-mender Sella Ward
(Net-Sella) and searching the shed row where sound and wind behave oddly.

DETAILED CONTINUITY – SCENE BY SCENE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Scene 1 – Morning at Anchorfall Inn – Day 5
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Context:
- Session begins from the previous state: Borian has finished trance and
  a quiet night at Anchorfall Inn, fully restored. It is early morning,
  Day 5 in Varengate, in a private room on Frostmere Row.

Parcel:
- Torven delivers a wrapped parcel left by an anonymous hooded figure
  earlier. The messenger avoided conversation and did not give a name.
- The parcel contains an aged, leatherbound book titled (working title,
  DM-only) "On Subsurface Flows and Structural Instability in Early
  Varengate Tiers." The text references understructure pressures,
  drainage patterns, and early granary-tier work.
- Book is mundane (no magical aura assumed). Its authorship is obscure.
  It appears aligned with existing "city-wide small anomalies" hooks.

Departure:
- Borian secures the book, choosing not to read it deeply on the spot.
- He gears up for the day and leaves Anchorfall with the intent to find
  income and keep an eye on the Hall board.

Scene 2 – Hall of Free Companies and Varrick Escort
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- At the Hall, workboard traffic is steady. Among routine slips, Borian
  selects a simple escort job: accompanying Varrick, a Hall assistant,
  to the Gildery Stacks.
- The escort proceeds without ambush or magical interference. Varrick's
  prior "misunderstanding" from the previous day is clarified as a
  mundane payment dispute, not criminal entanglement.
- The job pays 1 gp 8 sp. This payment was previously owed and is now
  explicitly recognized and recorded.

- Board notes:
  * Missing-fisher notice for Joren Vale is still present, but low on
    the board and neglected.
  * Granary-understructure posting remains open.
  * Assorted minor jobs (stall watches, errands) are available.

Scene 3 – Cooper's Run Clear-Out
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Job parameters:
- Borian accepts a "Cooper's Run clear-out" contract: 6 gp pay, with a
  hazard bonus possible if warranted. The task is to inspect and clear
  a drainage run where coopers have reported concerns.
- Assigned team:
  * Breda – junior structure tech, responsible for marking safe paths.
  * Lakan – lantern-hand, providing light and basic support.

Into the run:
- Borian establishes safety priorities with the team, explicitly stating
  that no job is worth their lives and no one is to go off alone. Breda
  leads, marking the route.
- Guidance is cast on Breda (Borian's touch / cantrip use). Breda's
  Perception check (13+2 from guidance) establishes baseline path-safety
  and hazard recognition.

Breach and anomaly:
- Deeper in Cooper's Run, the team finds:
  * A basin-like area with visible subsidence and stress.
  * A breach in the far wall where stone and mortar have been pushed
    outward from within, not collapsed inward.
  * A rhythmic cold draft and faint pulsing breeze through the breach.
  * A subtle sound like distant grating or movement, at measured
    intervals, suggesting something active deeper behind the stone.
- Borian uses his darkvision to recon ahead. Perception (15+2) confirms:
  * No immediate physical attackers or visible creatures.
  * No rubble poised for imminent collapse.
  * The breach is wrong in character: too clean a displacement, with
    stone and mortar pushed outward in a smooth arc, not jagged.

Decision and withdrawal:
- Borian judges that attempting to dig or widen the breach would be
  unsafe without structural bracing and specialized crew. The anomaly is
  real but not something a clear-out team should handle.
- He chooses to withdraw the team intact, instructing Breda to mark
  their route out and note the site carefully.
- He explicitly tells the pair to avoid embellishment and rumor; they
  are to describe what they saw, not speculate, to prevent panic.

Report and closure:
- Back at the Hall, the three prepare a detailed report:
  * Run is not in immediate danger of collapse.
  * Breach appears to originate from inside the wall, with smooth
    displacement and rhythmic cold draft.
  * Strange pulsing breeze and faint internal sounds noted.
  * The work requested (clear-out) is not the correct response; a
    specialized engineering / arcane team is needed.
- Borian praises the team in front of the clerk, recommending Breda and
  Lakan for future work requiring steady nerves.
- The Hall clerk closes the contract and pays Borian the 6 gp. The
  report is flagged for understructure review, tying it into the wider
  "city anomalies" arc.

Scene 4 – Marwen's Herbal Stall Watch – Mid-Tier Crossing
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Borian accepts a modest stall-watch job for Marwen of Lowridge at
  Mid-Tier Crossing (7 sp pay).
- Marwen:
  * Meticulous, high-standards herbal trader.
  * Gives strict instructions: no selling, no brewing, no rearranging,
    no letting hands wander off with stock.
- Borian holds a visible, attentive watch for roughly an hour. He
  remains present and does not pull out the understructure book, keeping
  his attention on the stall.

Observations:
- Foot traffic: apprentices, dockhands, families, browsers. No theft
  attempts. A few teenagers consider the brighter tinctures but back off
  under Borian's gaze.
- One courier (Perren) pauses, likely looking for Marwen but, finding
  her absent, moves on without leaving a message.

Trade in kind:
- Upon Marwen's return, Borian honestly reports a quiet watch and
  mentions the passing courier.
- He requests, instead of coin, something practical for cuts and
  bruises. Marwen assesses him as sensible and trustworthy, then trades
  herbal stock equal to 7 sp for additional Healer's Kit capacity.
- Mechanical result: Borian gains +3 uses to his Healer's Kit (field
  dressings, salve, woundwash). No coin changes hands.
- Marwen marks Borian mentally as a preferred future watcher.

Scene 5 – Hall Return and Missing-Fisher Contract
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Back at the Hall, Borian notes the absence of the Joren Vale notice on
  the active face of the board and asks the clerk about it.
- Clerk explains:
  * No confirmation of Joren's return.
  * Tidewardens performed a cursory shoreline sweep; nothing found.
  * Crew has not escalated beyond the initial report.
  * In absence of new information or a body, the case remains open but
    has slipped down the priority stack.
- Borian states he may take the case. The clerk brings the notice back
  up, promising to re-pin it where he can easily find it upon return.

Formal acceptance:
- After completing the herbalist job, Borian returns and pulls the Joren
  Vale slip from the board.
- The clerk records:
  * Contract: "Missing Fisher – Joren Vale."
  * Location focus: South Quay, Slip 12.
  * Possible leads: crew haunts – the Drowned Lantern and the Bitterline.
- Pay structure (per Hall policy and Companion economics) is confirmed:
  * Leads only: 1–3 gp for non-trivial, verifiable information.
  * Full resolution: 5–10 gp depending on outcome (10 gp if recovered
    alive).
  * Hazard bonus: +2–6 gp if significant danger encountered.
  * Multi-day searches: 8 sp per day sustenance, plus any lead / final
    payouts. Searchers are not expected to starve while serving the
    city.
- Borian raises concern about the elapsed five days; the clerk matches
  his realism but confirms the Hall will honor work and pay.

Scene 6 – South Quay, Slip 12 – The Mare's Wish
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Arrival and first read:
- Borian travels to South Quay. Slip 12 holds the *Mare's Wish*, a
  small, well-kept fishing vessel suitable for 1–3 crew on short runs.
- With a light Perception (10), Borian notes:
  * Lines properly fastened, knots tidy, no sign of panicked mooring.
  * Deck dry aside from normal spray; gear stowed neatly.
  * Nets, hooks, and buckets arranged as if at routine end-of-day.
  * No immediate blood or struggle evident on deck or dock.
- Tidewarden chalk mark on the mooring post indicates a prior official
  "checked" status, not a hazard flag.

Dockhands:
- On Slip 13, two dockhands (tall-thin and short-squint) clearly
  recognize the *Mare's Wish* and Joren's situation. They:
  * Confirm that Joren went out alone on a short evening line-cast.
  * Emphasize that such solo runs are common for competent fishers in
    calm water.
  * Note that if he had fallen overboard, the boat should have drifted
    or shown signs on lines and gear.
- Crucial detail:
  * They state the boat returned "tidy" – Joren must have moored her
    himself, stowed gear, and then left the vessel alive.
  * Their shared conclusion: whatever happened to Joren did not happen
    on the water.

Shed direction:
- The dockhands indirectly point Borian toward the Drowned Lantern for
  owner and crew, while also suggesting that walking the sheds near the
  ropeworks is the right next investigative step.
- No active hostility, just resigned concern. They do not conceal
  information but are cautious about gossip.

Scene 7 – The Drowned Lantern – Meeting Tannic Orls
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Approach:
- Borian enters the Drowned Lantern, taking stock of a midday harbor
  crowd of tired fishers and dock workers.
- At the bar, he requests "something hot that won't cloud a man's
  wits," and orders two hot spiced waters. He pays 1 sp (overpaying the
  nominal 2 cp cost). The barkeep quietly acknowledges his intent to
  approach Tannic Orls.

Initial contact:
- Tannic Orls is found in a corner: older, weathered, not drunk, staring
  at the table. He has not been sailing since Joren vanished.
- Borian sits with him, offering one of the heated drinks. Tannic reads
  this as a sign of seriousness rather than idle curiosity.

Establishing purpose:
- Borian explains he is newly in Varengate, has taken the Hall contract,
  and is not promising miracles, only honest effort.
- Tannic outlines the core situation:
  * Joren was a good, steady young fisher; not a drunk, debtor, or
    brawler.
  * Joren took the *Mare's Wish* out alone on a short evening line-cast
    in calm conditions.
  * The boat came back docked clean. Lines and gear are exactly how
    Joren left them – tidy and deliberate.
  * The horror is that Joren's trail ends after he returned and moored.

The sheds and witness:
- Tannic explains:
  * A net-mender, Sella Ward ("Net-Sella"), saw Joren step off the boat
    and walk toward the old storage sheds near the ropeworks.
  * Joren's walk was purposeful, not staggering or confused.
  * No one has seen him since.
- The sheds:
  * Five old harbor sheds past the salters' barrels and curing racks.
  * Second shed: dark-green door, hinge bent upward, pull left before
    pushing.
  * Fourth shed: compromised roof beam (unsafe to stand under).
  * Officially owned by the Harbor Office; practically neglected
    storage. Locks are old, mismatched, or warped.
  * Tidewardens and crew did a cursory "look" (door checks with lantern
    sweeps) but did not perform a real search for sign.

Multi-day search mechanics:
- Tannic and the Hall clerk together gave Borian clarity on how multi-
  day searches are treated economically (already summarized above). This
  reinforces that he can pursue the case without going hungry.

Net-Sella:
- Tannic identifies Net-Sella as:
  * A long-standing net-mender, sober, observant, not prone to gossip.
  * Working most afternoons at the drying racks or near ropeworks.
  * The last reliable witness to Joren's movements.
- Directions:
  * From Slip 12, up the ramp and right toward the net-drying racks.
  * Third rack from the north end is her usual station.
  * If not there, she likely assists at the nearby ropeworks stall.

Crew structure:
- Tannic explains his standard crew:
  * Himself at the tiller.
  * Donric on nets (loyal, volatile).
  * Harven on lines and catch (keen water-sense).
  * Joren as the third, green but steady and learning quickly.
- For short line-casts, one competent hand can crew the *Mare's Wish*
  alone. Joren was trusted for such runs.

Emotional stakes:
- Tannic confirms they have not taken the *Mare's Wish* back out since
  Joren's disappearance:
  * Donric wanted to resume immediately.
  * Harven refused to step aboard without knowing Joren's fate.
  * Tannic himself will not sail while one of his crew remains missing
    without explanation.
- Borian offers a quiet, heartfelt reflection on hope ("Hope is not
  fragile—..."), grounding Tannic's grief rather than offering false
  comfort. This strengthens trust.

Permission to board:
- At session's close, Borian stands and requests permission to board the
  *Mare's Wish* as part of the investigation.
- Tannic grants full permission:
  * Borian may board and inspect the vessel at will.
  * If challenged, he is to say the boat answers to him, by Tannic's
    leave, until the matter is resolved.
  * Tannic requests that any findings, good or bad, be reported to him
    first before rumor or official channels twist them.

HIDDEN DM THREADS (NOT FOR CODEX)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Understructure / anomaly linkage:
  * Cooper's Run breach, the understructure anomalies near the granary,
    and prior Frost-Kiln seam phenomena all point toward increasing
    instability or movement below Varengate's lower tiers.
  * The cold pulsing draft and smooth inward-to-outward displacement at
    Cooper's Run are consistent with non-natural pressure or phased
    displacement rather than normal erosion.

- Shed row phenomenon:
  * The old sheds near the ropeworks sit above a section of under-tier
    corridors related to older harbor drainage and forgotten service
    routes.
  * "Wind forgetting to move" and sound-dampening in that area are
    manifestations of the same deeper-layer disturbance, not classic
    hauntings.
  * It is possible Joren encountered either an understructure anomaly, a
    covert operation, or a liminal crossing effect in/near Shed Two.

- Joren's disappearance:
  * Joren did not die at sea; his fate is tied to events on land after
    docking.
  * The trail leads through Net-Sella → sheds → understructure.
  * Family, debts, and criminal associations are not primary drivers;
    focus is on city/under-tier phenomena or third-party interference.

- Social ripple:
  * Borian's measured approach with Tannic, the prayerful moment, and
    his refusal to give false hope elevate him in the quiet estimation
    of harborfolk who overheard fragments.
  * Tannic, if satisfied by future truth (even tragic), may become a
    strong ally and advocate among the harborfront.

- Economic / Hall reputation:
  * The Hall notes Borian's willingness to pick up an old, neglected
    missing-person contract, which few freelancers want.
  * His handling of Cooper's Run and Marwen's stall builds a reputation
    of cautious professionalism and restraint rather than reckless
    bravado.
