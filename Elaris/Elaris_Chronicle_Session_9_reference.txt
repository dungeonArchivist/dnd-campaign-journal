WEATHER / ATMOSPHERE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Cold, clear winter air across both days. Harborfront carries sharp
brine and fish scents, while upper tiers remain dry and crisp.
Skies stay mostly clear; no storms, no fog. Streets are lively but
not frantic – the city feels alert, not yet strained.

LOCATIONS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Anchorfall Inn (common room, private room)
- Grayharp Market (stalls, Kessa’s usual route)
- Kessa’s loft building and alley
- Scriptorium Terrace (west buttress pocket)
- Frostmere Row and Rella’s bakery
- Contract Hall
- Ropeworks Lane and checkpoint
- Tidewarden Station B (Mid-Tier)
- Tidewarden Station C (Harborfront)
- Harborfront broker’s ring
- Mid-Tier tax office

SESSION SUMMARY (HIGH LEVEL)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Confirmed Kessa’s unexplained absence; initial investigation
  found a likely stopping point but no clear trail.
- Met Mara Rhensyr discreetly; agreed to observe anomalies without
  further reports to Aleron until more is understood.
- Advanced lock training with Harn and personal study; continued
  work with the mysterious book.
- Deepened rapport with Rill via hearth magic and paladin
  philosophy; reinforced ties with Rella, Torven, and others.
- Completed multiple small contracts (escort, runners, relay) and
  earned recognition from Tidewarden Station B as a reliable hand.
- Received Mara’s formal follow-up message, setting a private
  meeting for mid-afternoon Day 8.

DETAILED CONTINUITY – SCENE BY SCENE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Scene 1 – Morning at Anchorfall (Day 7)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Borian collects his cleaned practical clothes from Torven,
  changing out of the finer outfit worn the day before into warm,
  durable garments better suited to daily work.
- Over breakfast and coffee, Borian and Torven talk about work:
  the Hall’s small contracts pay too little, and Borian wants more
  substantial, discreet engagements.
- Torven notes that word is spreading about “the elf who handles
  trouble,” hinting at a growing reputation around the harbor and
  Grayharp tiers.

Scene 2 – Grayharp and Kessa’s Absence (Day 7)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Borian heads to Grayharp to visit Kessa and repay a favor.
- The fishmonger recognizes him on sight and reports that Kessa
  never arrived at the market and never hung her loft lantern last
  night – behavior everyone agrees is unlike her.
- At Kessa’s building, a neighbor confirms she did not return. The
  door is locked; windows and rear access show no obvious signs of
  forced entry.
- Borian checks the alley and calls her name from behind the
  building. Low investigation and perception rolls reveal no clear
  disturbance, making it impossible to determine what happened at
  the loft itself.
- Back at Grayharp, Borian talks with Larynn and others to piece
  together Kessa’s last known route. A later, more focused pass
  identifies a likely point along her walk where she seems to have
  stopped or vanished.
- A failed follow-up investigation roll leaves the direction and
  cause unknown. The market is worried but has not filed a formal
  contract. The matter remains unresolved.

Scene 3 – Return to Anchorfall and Reputation Talk (Day 7)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Borian returns to Anchorfall and tells Torven that Kessa appears
  to be missing and that his initial search reached a dead end.
- They talk about the way Borian’s name is circulating: useful for
  finding work, but a liability for anyone who needs to move
  quietly. Borian recognizes that a public reputation and discreet
  work may soon come into tension.
- Borian expresses frustration with piecemeal jobs and the desire
  for contracts that matter more than a handful of coins.

Scene 4 – Scriptorium Terrace and Mara Rhensyr (Day 7)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Borian receives word, via Torven, that a civic official wishes to
  speak with him about the anomalies he has been encountering.
- At Scriptorium Terrace, Borian arrives early, studies the space,
  and identifies a small pocket near the west buttress that offers
  privacy from casual observation while remaining reachable to
  anyone searching for him.
- A perception check (15+2) confirms no watchers at elevation and
  no obvious ambush. The terrace is active but not tense.
- Mara Rhensyr arrives, professional and controlled. Borian lets
  her confirm him at a distance before stepping with her into the
  chosen pocket.
- Borian recounts the anomalies he has personally witnessed:
  residues and trails at the western granary; the frost-kiln seam
  and moving cold shadow; the void space in Shed Two; the Joren
  rescue and its understructure context; Cooper’s Run.
- He makes clear that all of this was already reported to Harbor
  Warden Aleron Vale, who had asked Borian to review maps and mark
  anomaly sites.
- An insight check (19+2) reads Mara as genuinely worried about the
  city rather than self-serving. She is not fully forthcoming but
  is not lying to Borian.
- Mara asks Borian to continue observing anomalies but not to
  report further findings to Aleron until she can compare her own
  information with his actions. She wants an independent line of
  sight.
- Borian agrees in principle, requesting a day to think and for
  her to find a more private time and place for a deeper brief. He
  notes privately that Aleron’s unpaid debt gives him an honest
  pretext to step back from further unpaid work.
- Mara promises to send word to Anchorfall once she is ready to
  meet again and slips away without drawing attention.

Scene 5 – Lodging, Harn’s Training, and Evening Study (Day 7)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Back at Anchorfall, Borian and Torven address lodging. Given
  gaps in prior ledger detail, Borian chooses a clean settlement:
  he pays 16 sp to cover two nights and clear any question of debt.
- Borian then visits Harn the locksmith to move beyond theory and
  into practice. He explains that he has read the book and worked
  his own locks but lacks the “feel” of real tools.
- Harn brings out a selection of picks and locks, guiding Borian
  through tension, pin feedback, and typical failure points.
- This extended afternoon session counts as a major step in
  Borian’s lock-training track (Training Scene 4).
- After supper at Anchorfall, Borian spends additional time in his
  room:
  - practicing on his three purchased locks,
  - revisiting key passages in the lockwork compendium,
  - and then studying the mysterious book left by the courier.
- A handwriting comparison check (9–1) fails to match the margin
  notes to any writing he has seen in Varengate.
- He reads until around 23:00, then enters a four-hour trance.

Scene 6 – Hearthfire and Paladin Talk with Rill (Day 8)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Pre-dawn on Day 8, Borian wakes from trance and heads down to
  the common room. Rill is there, having slept by the hearth to
  tend the morning fire.
- Borian invites Rill to join him in kindling the fire, using
  Prestidigitation to ignite the prepared logs. Rill is quietly
  delighted, and Borian plays along, letting Rill take some credit
  for the early blaze.
- They sit together, and Borian explains what a paladin is: a
  person whose oath and devotion bend the world around them, not
  merely a “holy warrior.”
- Borian shares, in guarded terms, the story of his past command,
  the accident that killed many of his men, and the loss that led
  him to swear his oath in service to the Verdant Balance.
- The conversation turns to choice, courage, and the difference
  between knowing the right thing and acting on it. Borian frames
  right action as a practice built on many small decisions, not a
  single heroic moment.
- This talk deepens Rill’s understanding of Borian and nudges him
  toward seeing himself as someone whose choices matter.

Scene 7 – Baker’s Bench and Bread Shared (Day 8)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Later that morning, Borian visits Rella’s bakery on Frostmere
  Row. Already aware of his skill from Session VIII, she allows him
  to step back into the rhythm of dough work.
- Borian shapes and works multiple batches, using practiced
  motions and professional technique. The interaction is one of
  colleagues, not master and novice.
- When the work allows, he takes a fresh piece of bread and brings
  it back to Anchorfall, breaking it into thirds for Torven, Rill,
  and himself.
- This shared bread reinforces Borian’s role as a quiet contributor
  to the inn’s household and ties his past life as “chef” into his
  present place in Varengate.

Scene 8 – Hall Contracts and Field Work (Day 8)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Borian returns to the Contract Hall and reviews the day’s board.
  The postings are mostly small, routine work.
- He selects a spice-cart escort for Rylen Fedro, providing right-
  flank protection on the route from Grayharp to the Mid-Tier
  Gate. A perception check (13+2 used earlier) confirms that the
  path is clear. Notably, the usual pickpocket cluster at a
  switchback is absent – unusual, but not overtly dangerous.
- Rylen pays the agreed 5 sp and remarks that he would hire Borian
  again.
- Borian then takes a runner job delivering assessment records
  from the Hall to Tidewarden Station C, completes the delivery,
  and returns for 3 sp payment.
- On Frostmere Row, he fulfills a lamp-recovery posting by
  retrieving Harl Kien’s fallen lantern from a runoff channel and
  returning it for 2 sp.
- A separate courier job follows: Borian picks up a sealed ledger
  from a Harborfront broker’s stall and transports it to the Mid-
  Tier tax office, earning 2 sp upon confirmation.

Scene 9 – Tidewarden Station B Relay and Return (Day 8)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Seeking better work than Hall scraps, Borian goes directly to
  Tidewarden Station B and asks the desk sergeant about available
  tasks.
- The sergeant, short on personnel, offers internal assignments.
  Borian accepts a relay job carrying sealed packets between
  Station B, Station C, and the Ropeworks checkpoint.
- Borian delivers the blue-cord packet to Station C (Records), the
  green-cord packet to the Ropeworks checkpoint, and finally
  returns the red-cord packet to Station B.
- The sergeant pays 5 sp and notes that Borian “works clean,”
  marking him informally as a trusted external runner for future
  needs.

Scene 10 – Mara’s Note and Session Close (Day 8)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Returning to Anchorfall near midday, Borian checks the message
  counter and finds a folded note held beneath a river stone.
- In his room, he opens it privately. The handwriting is Mara
  Rhensyr’s: precise and professional.
- The note reads "Meeting confirmed. Mid-afternoon. Scriptorium
  Terrace, west buttress. Same discretion as before. Come alone."
- Session IX ends with Borian in his room at Anchorfall, note in
  hand, and the afternoon meeting ahead.

ALLIES / RELATIONSHIPS CHANGES
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Torven: Deepening practical trust; Borian settles lodging
  cleanly and continues to help without drama.
- Rill: Relationship shifts toward quiet mentorship; Rill now sees
  Borian as a moral and magical example.
- Rella (baker): Positive; sees Borian as a capable pair of hands
  and not just a passerby.
- Harn (locksmith): Developing professional respect; ongoing
  training relationship.
- Harl Kien (rope stall): Positive; grateful for lantern recovery.
- Rylen Fedro (spice broker): Professional; would reasonably seek
  Borian again for future escorts.
- Mara Rhensyr: New, cautious alliance; shared concern over
  anomalies, with a request for discretion.
- Tidewarden Station B sergeant: Positive; sees Borian as a clean,
  reliable outside operative.

ITEMS / CONTRACTS CHANGES
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Items:
  - No major new items gained or lost this session.
  - Practice locks, lockwork compendium, and mysterious book remain
    in Borian’s possession.
- Contracts Completed:
  - Spice cart escort (Rylen Fedro) – completed, paid.
  - Assessment packet runner (Hall to Station C) – completed, paid.
  - Lamp recovery (Harl Kien’s lantern) – completed, paid.
  - Harborfront ledger courier (broker to tax office) – completed,
    paid.
  - Tidewarden internal relay (Station B circuit) – completed,
    paid.
- Contracts Ongoing:
  - Granary understructure disturbances (Hall).
  - Unofficial anomaly observations for Aleron Vale.
  - Mara Rhensyr anomaly briefing – follow-up meeting scheduled.
- Not Formalized (but active as a thread):
  - Kessa’s disappearance – no contract opened, but concern and
    partial investigation established.

HIDDEN DM THREADS (NOT FOR CODEX)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Anomaly Pressure:
  - The absence of the usual pickpocket cluster at the switchback
    is a small but notable deviation in city pattern, aligning with
    the “world is stirring, not unraveling” tone.
  - Mara’s independent interest in anomalies sets up a potential
    tension between civic records and Aleron’s handling.
- Social Positioning:
  - Borian’s consistent reliability with Tidewardens and Hall work
    makes him a plausible choice for more sensitive civic tasks.
  - Grayharp, Anchorfall, Frostmere Row, and Harborfront all have
    NPCs who can now believably recommend him.
- Kessa Thread:
  - Her absence is established, witnessed, and now emotionally
    anchored in Grayharp. Whether mundane or tied to deeper
    patterns, the situation can escalate without feeling forced.
- Mara vs. Aleron:
  - Borian is now positioned between two information centers:
    Aleron (harbor authority) and Mara (records and civic survey).
    Either may react if they discover withheld reports.
- Lock Training:
  - At 5 / 10 scenes toward half proficiency, Borian is halfway to
    functional competency with basic locks, which may matter in
    future urban or understructure scenes.
