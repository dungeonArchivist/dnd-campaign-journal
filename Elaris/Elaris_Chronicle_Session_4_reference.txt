TIMEFRAME
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Covers the tail end of Day 2 in Varengate and most of Day 3.

Approximate clock:
- ~18:00–24:00 Day 2: Anchorfall → missed dead-drop meet → Frost-Kiln
  night watch and ventstone event → brief Hall of Free Companies visit →
  Anchorfall (meal / trance).

SESSION SUMMARY (HIGH LEVEL)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Session IV spans the aftermath of the missed dead-drop meeting, the full
night at the Frost-Kiln, the first messenger job and dead-drop handled
cleanly, and Borian’s recruitment into a deeper shard-recovery contract
that leads him into Surnhal heritage and memory-loom lore. He confirms
that a rare shard has passed from a mule-trader to Kessa, then to
Tavran, then to an inland buyer, and finally tracks the buyer’s trail to
the doorstep of Herda Fenwater, an herbalist from Surnhal. Herda
explains the shard’s nature and warns that the buyer will likely return.
The session closes with Borian maintaining a prayerful stakeout in the
overhang corridor, waiting for that return.

DETAILED CONTINUITY – SCENE BY SCENE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Scene 1 – Anchorfall Inn, Room 3 – Evening (Day 2)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Context:
- Session picks up from the Session III end state: Borian has completed
  a long rest, it is early evening (~tenth bell), and he is in Room 3 at
  the Anchorfall.

Note under door:
- Borian hears a knock, opens the door, and finds a folded note rather
  than a person. The corridor outside is quiet.
- Note contents (paraphrased from prior sessions’ canon, not fully
  reprinted here): instruction to meet one hour after the eleventh bell
  at a specified location (dead-drop / contact point), with no name
  signed. This ties into ongoing “Rulfen / Drowned Lantern” dead-drop
  hooks and the previous missed contact.
- Borian picks up the note and closes the door, reviews the Frost-Kiln
  firewatch posting again to reconcile the timing of his commitments.
- Bells clarification this session:
  * Eleventh bell = ~23:00 by rough city clock.
  * “One hour after” = twelfth bell (~24:00 / midnight).
  * Shops are generally closing around the tenth to eleventh bells.
  * There are no public bells during deepest night; the bell-cycle
    resumes at first-light.

Planning:
- Borian confirms both the cryptic meet and the Frost-Kiln firewatch are
  effectively scheduled around the same late-night window.
- He determines he will go early to the meet location, observe from
  concealment, and if the contact does appear, keep the interaction
  short in order to still make the Frost-Kiln shift.

Scene 2 – Approach to the Meet and Missed Contact – Late Night (Day 2)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Travel and stealth:
- Borian leaves the Anchorfall with enough lead time to arrive ~20
  minutes before the set meeting hour. Streets are thinning but not
  deserted.
- He chooses a concealed vantage overlooking the meeting point rather
  than standing openly in the agreed spot.
- Stealth check: 11+1 = 12. He is reasonably unobtrusive, not utterly
  invisible but not drawing attention in the dim environment.
- Distance: He is positioned several building-lengths away with line of
  sight, close enough to see approach routes but not close enough for
  easy casual conversation.

Observation:
- Perception check while watching: 12+2 = 14. He sees one cloaked figure
  arrive early, pause near the meeting location, scan the surroundings,
  then move on without revealing any signal or making direct contact.
  The figure does not appear obviously tied to Borian or the prior
  dead-drops.
- Borian decides this might not be “his” contact and chooses not to break
  cover.

Waiting through the hour:
- Borian waits the full hour past the eleventh bell. No other figures
  arrive with obvious purposeful behavior matching a clandestine meet.
- After the agreed time has elapsed, he breaks cover and moves to the
  meeting point itself.

Site check:
- Investigation / Perception check at the meeting point: result low
  (8–1 = 7 on a relevant check). No hidden notes, signals, or items are
  detected. No sign that a drop was left and removed.
- Conclusion: The meeting did not occur as planned; either the other
  party did not risk the contact, or the earlier figure chose not to
  engage.

Scene 3 – Travel to Frost-Kiln and Initial Assessment – Late Night
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Context:
- With the arranged hour for the meet passed, Borian heads for the
  Frost-Kiln workshop to fulfill the night watch contract.

Approach:
- As he walks, he deliberately maintains situational awareness of the
  streets, checking for anyone trailing him or lingering in the shadows.
- Perception check: 4+2 = 6 (explicitly noted in play as “this is not my
  night with the dice”). No deliberate tail is detected; it is possible
  someone careful could be following, but no obvious stalker emerges.

Arrival and environment:
- The Frost-Kiln workshop is active inside despite the late hour: furnaces
  banked low but still hot, ambient heat battling winter cold. Metal,
  stone, and tools are organized, with workers finishing their shifts.
- Borian assesses the space as he enters:
  * Perception: 13+2 = 15. He notes venting structures, heavy machinery,
    the west wall with recently repaired boards, and general worker
    flow. No immediate threat.

Meeting Bram:
- Bram (foreman) greets Borian with a practical, no-nonsense manner. He
  asks if Borian is familiar with pipes, ballast systems, or “ventstones”
  before fully explaining the situation.
- Borian offers a brief joke feigning ignorance, then clarifies he is
  present as security, not a cooling engineer.
- The two quickly establish:
  * Bram expected someone who could not only stand watch but also
    recognize tampering with cooling infrastructure.
  * Borian clarifies his limits, and Bram agrees to direct him precisely
    on what to observe.

Misaligned expectations:
- Borian points out that the posted notice did not specify technical
  expertise. Bram concedes this was poorly worded: he wanted someone
  trustworthy present during a suspicious night rather than general
  guard duty, but the job board language didn’t capture that nuance.
- Agreement: Borian will act as watchman and extra set of eyes; Bram
  remains responsible for technical decisions.

Scene 4 – West Wall, Pry Marks, and Ventstone – Late Night
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Board disturbance:
- Bram brings Borian to the west wall, where boards were previously
  pried up. From inside, the pry marks clearly originate from the
  interior, not the alley:
  * Nails bent outward.
  * Tool marks angled from within.
- Borian reconstructs aloud:
  * Someone inside the factory pried open the boards from within,
    accessing the vent shaft or passing something through.
    Then they nailed them back from inside, suggesting they either
    remained inside afterward or left in a way that would not raise
    suspicion.

Outside vs inside:
- Insightful deduction: Borian notes that if the boards were replaced
  from inside, whoever did it either:
  * Belonged there or could leave without notice.
  * Was assisting someone outside, passing an item, then covering their
    tracks.
- Bram confirms no record of authorized work on that wall.

Ventstone inspection:
- At Bram’s direction, Borian inspects a ventstone in the floor area
  adjacent to the wall:
  * Investigation: 9–1 = 8. He sees no missing chunks, no obvious tunnel
    large enough for a person, no clear breach of the stone itself.
  * The stone may channel air or pressure but is not visibly damaged.
- Borian reports honestly that he cannot see how anyone could have fit
  through or how something significant could have been removed via the
  narrow interface visible to him.

Scene 5 – Exterior Check and Failed Tracking – Late Night
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Going outside:
- Borian goes out to the alley to check the external side of the west
  wall.
- Perception at the exterior: 6+2 = 8. He spots the same general area of
  disturbance but no obvious new marks beyond the prior pry attempts.
- He makes a Survival check to see if he can find tracks or direction:
  * Survival: 5+2 = 7. Street traffic and weather of the last two days
    have obscured any clearer sign of where an intruder might have come
    from or gone to.
- Conclusion: Too much time and foot traffic have passed; he cannot
  reconstruct a route from outside.

Return inside:
- Returning to the interior, Borian relays his findings: there is no
  recoverable trail in the alley. Bram accepts this assessment and
  shifts focus to present-moment vigilance.

Scene 6 – Posting Up and the Seam in the Stone – Late Night
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Posting duties:
- Borian chooses a position where he can:
  * Watch the ventstone.
  * Watch the west wall.
  * Stay clear of workers’ paths.
- He confirms the workshop’s usual night pattern (whether workers stay
  or leave). Bram notes that some late work will wind down, and then
  only a skeleton presence remains.

Discovery of coat:
- Bram points out a missing worker’s coat, believed to belong to a man
  who left early the night of the attempted break-in. The coat hangs
  near the area of concern.
- Borian examines the coat (Investigation: 2–1 = 1); he finds no visible
  stains, rips, or residues that tell him anything useful.

The seam:
- As night deepens, workers finish and eventually leave. Bram and Borian
  remain.
- The ventstone and adjacent seam begin to show subtle signs:
  * A hairline crack, slight shifting or “breathing” motion.
  * A shadow passes along the seam not entirely tied to the forge light.
  * A faint sensory discomfort, more intuitive than overt.
- Perception checks during this vigil were modest; Borian identifies a
  “shadow passing at the seam” but without enough to fully define it.

Decision point:
- Borian presses Bram to evacuate anyone nonessential, stating plainly
  that a factory is not worth their lives. Bram agrees to clear out all
  remaining workers but insists on staying himself.
- Borian offers to remain as well and does so, standing ready with his
  sword drawn and eyes on the seam.

Scene 7 – Aftermath and Agreement with Bram – Early Morning (Day 3)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Seam stabilizes:
- The seam’s activity does not escalate to open confrontation this
  session. The presence fades back into stillness, leaving only unease
  and a sense of pressure deferred rather than resolved.

Shutdown:
- Bram acknowledges the risk. He resolves to:
  * Suspend operations in the affected section.
  * Notify relevant guild / city oversight that something is wrong with
    the understructure.
- Borian presses for clarity: what about the workers and the future of
  the factory? Bram responds that he will reduce night activity and
  accept short-term loss over potential disaster.

Payment and reference:
- The Frost-Kiln contract listed 20 sp. Bram indicates that he will
  report Borian’s presence and performance to the Hall. No explicit
  at-table coin exchange scene occurs this session; payment is pending
  confirmation via Bram’s follow-up at the Hall.
- Bram asks where Borian can be found for future work. This triggered a
  brief continuity slip (Bram knowing the inn name unprompted). Canon
  fix: Borian explicitly tells Bram he can be reached via the Anchorfall
  and the Hall.

Scene 8 – Hall of Free Companies Check-In – Early Morning (Day 3)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Borian goes to the Hall after leaving the Frost-Kiln, before sleep:
  * Reports that the night watch was served and that “interesting
    phenomena” remain at the Frost-Kiln.
  * Tells the clerk that Bram will provide details.
- The contract remains flagged as “in progress / pending verification”
  rather than fully closed. No explicit payment is processed at the
  counter in this scene.
- This leaves the Frost-Kiln contract mechanically in a “completed in
  fact, awaiting bureaucratic confirmation” state at the end of the
  Frost-Kiln arc.

Scene 9 – Anchorfall: Meal, Trance, and Morning – Morning (Day 3)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Borian returns to the Anchorfall after the Hall check-in, exhausted.
- Torven provides food (breakfast fare or reheated stew depending on the
  hour). No charge is levied this scene; Torven treats Borian as a
  valued regular.
- Borian returns to his room and enters elven trance.
- Four-hour trance covers the late morning window, leaving Borian
  mentally rested and physically reset by mid-morning.

Scene 10 – Morning at Anchorfall and Talking with Torven – Day 3
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Borian returns to the common room. Light crowd at breakfast; a few
  laborers, early traders.
- He orders coffee and declines more food, still satisfied.
- Once the room thins, he catches Torven for conversation and recounts:
  * The granary understructure anomalies.
  * The completed ship mediation (from prior session).
  * The note and missed meeting.
  * The Frost-Kiln seam and decision to shut down the active area.
- Torven’s counsel:
  * Warns Borian about stacking too many shady or off-book jobs.
  * Encourages him to find a crew with aligned values to avoid being
    “the one disposable blade in someone else’s story.”
  * Points out that word gets around, and reputations stick.

Scene 11 – Hall of Free Companies: Messenger Job – Morning (Day 3)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Messenger posting:
- Back at the Hall, Borian checks the board and reads a messenger request
  in detail:
  * Deliver a sealed letter from the Hall side to a contact at the upper
    docks (“L.”) using a minimal phrase as confirmation.
  * Secondary instruction: drop the letter at a particular spot in
    Whisper-Row for a recipient identified only by pattern, not name.
  * Reward: modest silver (exact amount not explicitly set at table; coin
    change left unstated here pending numeric confirmation).

Upper docks hand-off:
- Borian meets a man at the upper docks who responds to the given phrase
  (“Looking for ‘L’,” etc.) and produces the sealed letter.
- Insight: 12+2 = 14. Man appears cautious but businesslike, not overtly
  deceptive; his concern is that the drop be handled cleanly.
- Man gives Borian minimal instructions:
  * After drop, return here.
  * If drop is compromised, do nothing dramatic.

Whisper-Row dead-drop:
- Borian travels to Whisper-Row, finds the designated location, and
  conducts the dead-drop:
  * Avoids drawing attention.
  * Places the letter where instructed.
  * Does not linger to see who collects it.
- Concern is voiced in-character about lack of proof for successful
  drop, but the job’s nature does not permit a signed receipt.

Return and completion:
- Borian returns to the upper docks contact.
- The man says “Completely,” indicating satisfaction with the unseen
  receiver’s confirmation.
- Payment is made according to the job’s terms, but since the exact
  amount was never stated in play, this reference file does not record a
  specific numeric coin change. (State file should only be updated when
  a concrete amount is set.)

Scene 12 – Anchorfall and Torven’s Counsel on Shadier Work – Late Morning
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Back at the Anchorfall, Borian checks in with Torven again:
  * Mentions the messenger run and the nature of the contact.
  * Asks Torven if this kind of work has a reputation.
- Torven’s advice:
  * Such jobs can be either stepping-stones or traps depending on who
    ultimately holds the strings.
  * Warns that “dead-drops and missing names” often belong to guilds,
    independents, or those wanting deniability.

Scene 13 – Hall: Shard Inquiry from Aleron – Late Morning / Midday
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Borian returns once more to the Hall.
- Aleron has a more detailed private inquiry:
  * A crystal shard sought by a “private collector.”
  * The shard is sketched: concave face, radiating lattice, irregular
    edges.
- Payment structure (after in-session correction using economics doc):
  * 10 silver per day retainer, up to three days.
  * 25 gp on successful recovery.
  * Reasonable incidental costs (small bribes, modest purchase of the
    item if necessary) can be reimbursed if documented.
- Borian challenges the numbers; Aleron clarifies based on risk tier.
  User explicitly called out that earlier numbers were wrong; above
  terms are accepted as canonical.

Meeting arrangement:
- Aleron sets a contact point at the lower ridge overlook with the
  collector’s agent.
- Instructions:
  * Go alone.
  * Listen first.
  * Collector prefers discretion.

Scene 14 – Lower Ridge Overlook: Meeting the Collector’s Agent – Midday
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Borian travels to the lower ridge overlook:
  * A terrace-like vantage with view over city tiers.
  * Not especially crowded at the chosen hour.

Initial read:
- He meets a composed, cloaked man who clearly expected someone.
- Insight: 12+2 = 14. Agent reads as self-controlled, neither braggart
  nor thug; his tone and posture indicate he’s used to handling quiet,
  serious matters.

Job details:
- The agent:
  * Confirms he represents a private collector.
  * States the shard is believed to be in Varengate, having passed
    through multiple hands.
  * Shares a sketch of the shard, consistent with Aleron’s.
  * Asks whether Borian is thief, buyer, or seeker. Borian frames
    himself as a seeker aligning with “truth” and an honorable private
    claim.

Compensation:
- The same payment structure is restated and accepted.
- Borian confirms:
  * He may need to negotiate, buy, or otherwise retrieve the shard.
  * Modest expenses (for information or purchase) will be reimbursed,
    but only within reasonable bounds.

Names:
- Borian offers “Borian Elmsworn” openly.
- The agent does not give a personal name; he prefers not to tie his
  employer’s identity to the search.
- If pressed in conversation with others, Borian is to describe the
  interest as belonging to “a private collector” without naming any
  house or guild.

Direction given:
- Starting point: Grayharp Market, particularly stalls dealing in
  curios, trinkets, and minor crystals.
- Tavran’s name surfaces as a likely contact from earlier trade rumors.

Scene 15 – Grayharp Market and Kessa – Early Afternoon (Day 3)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Borian goes to Grayharp Market and finds Kessa, a merchant dealing in
  small goods and curios.
- He asks about “prayer crystals” with special weight or significance.
- Kessa shows ordinary goods first, then acknowledges she recently
  handled something more unusual:
  * A shard brought by a mule-trader who came through from inland roads,
    plausibly from Surnhal.
  * The trader treated the shard as loot found in a saddlebag, wanted
    only coin, and did not understand its worth.
  * She sold it to Tavran.
- Insight: 9+2 = 11 (from prior roll during this scene). Kessa appears
  cautious but not deceitful; she is cagey primarily because this kind
  of trade can attract attention.
- She hints at wanting a future favor rather than immediate coin from
  Borian in exchange for pointing him to Tavran.

Scene 16 – Tavran’s Shop – Early Afternoon
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Tavran’s shop near the fountain is orderly, lined with carefully kept
  metal and crystal items.
- Borian shows his personal shard quietly to build context and rapport.
- Tavran:
  * Confirms that Kessa sold him a shard matching the sketch.
  * Describes it:
    - Concave face designed to hold or focus something.
    - Subtle lattice-thread pattern in its interior.
  * States it “did not feel like ordinary glass.”
- On the buyer:
  * Tavran describes the buyer as shorter than Borian, lean, gray-eyed,
    wearing soft-soled boots and a plain dark coat.
  * The buyer asked for the shard by description, not by seeing it in
    the case, implying prior knowledge.
  * He paid competently and left without drama.
  * Direction of departure: north from the fountain, then east into
    residential tiers.

- Borian offers a small magical service (prestidigitation to clean a
  tide-keeper device), which earns Tavran’s genuine appreciation and
  trust. This solidifies Tavran as a reliable future contact.

Scene 17 – Tracking the Buyer Through East-Tier Lanes – Mid Afternoon
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Borian follows Tavran’s direction:
  * North from the fountain.
  * East into narrower, quieter lanes.
- Checks:
  * Perception / Survival combination with at least one strong roll
    (Survival at one point effectively ~20–22 after guidance and Wis
    bonus in a later stretch of the chase).
  * He picks out:
    - Fine scuff marks from soft-soled boots.
    - Occasional dragged heel near curb stones.
    - One small fiber from a brown coat snagged on stone.
  * He also notes a faint bitter-herb smell down one approach, helping
    distinguish a path toward residential herbal houses.

Dead-end square:
- The trail leads to a small square with three doors and a modest
  central space.
- Doors:
  * Left: older couple’s home. Dust undisturbed at threshold.
  * Right: Berrin Hale’s workshop (woodturner). Door slightly ajar,
    typical for his habits. No matching tracks.
  * Center: small herb garden in spiral form, brass leaf-and-thread
    plate, red-marked stone, green painted stripe across the door.
- Footprint evidence:
  * The buyer’s tracks approach the center door, pause, pivot, and
    retreat.
  * No sign of entry at any of the three doors.

Scene 18 – Lidena’s Apothecary – Mid / Late Afternoon
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Borian backtracks slightly to a mid-tier apothecary he passed:
  “Lidena’s Remedies.”
- Inside:
  * Shelves of tinctures and herbs.
  * Warm but not crowded.
- Insight: 19+2 = 21. Lidena reads as genuinely kind and trustworthy.
- Borian describes the square and the house with the herb garden and
  brass plate. Lidena:
  * Identifies the central house as belonging to Herda Fenwater, an
    herbalist from Surnhal who has lived here many years.
  * Confirms Berrin Hale’s workshop door is often left slightly open out
    of habit.
- She gives Borian a sprig of calming mint “for his nerves” and
  encourages him to approach Herda politely.

Scene 19 – Herda Fenwater’s House – Late Afternoon
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Entry and read:
- Borian knocks. Herda answers cautiously. He introduces the visit as a
  private matter, mentioning that Lidena vouched for him.
- Herda invites him inside. Interior is orderly, with drying herbs,
  Surnhal-style arrangements, and quiet, lived-in atmosphere.

Initial exchange:
- Borian explains:
  * He is following a trail, not accusing her of anything.
  * The tracks and signs suggest a man from Surnhal, carrying a shard,
    came to this square and paused at her door.
- Herda:
  * Correctly perceives Borian as more seeker than thug.
  * Accepts conversation in good faith.

Memory-loom lore:
- Borian produces the sketch of the shard.
- Herda identifies it as a type of “memory-loom” shard used by old
  Surnhal families to preserve lived memories.
- She gives structured background (which Borian hears but cannot yet
  fully connect to names):
  * Five family lines historically known for such shards:
    - Fenwater – herbal and mourning memory.
    - Velthran – river-wardens.
    - Lethamir – memory-weavers and technical lore.
    - Daelrun – oath and contract keepers.
    - Tairneth – wanderers carrying painful stories.
- Herda explains:
  * Memory-looms are for inheritance, not trade.
  * Seeing one in a mule’s saddlebag implies that its keeper died on the
    road or that it was taken without proper transfer.
- Borian reports the mule-trader story from Kessa / Tavran: shard found
  in saddlebag on a mule brought from Surnhal; trader wanted coin only.

Buyers and claims:
- Borian frames his employer as “a private collector” whom he believes
  honorable.
- Herda raises the question: if both a family with lineage claim and a
  private collector seek the shard, who has the stronger right?
- Herda clarifies that the man Borian followed is likely acting on
  someone else’s errand, retracing the last steps of a dead shard-
  keeper, not collecting curios.

Door markers and buyer hesitation:
- Herda and Borian review the symbols at her door:
  * Leaf-thread plate: marks her house as herblore / Fenwater heritage.
  * Spiral herb beds: suggest knowledge patterns, not simple decor.
  * Red-marked stone: indicates “someone home” in Surnhal-coded fashion.
  * Green stripe: sign of work and availability, not magical ward.
- Herda’s conclusion:
  * A Surnhal-informed seeker would recognize these as markers of a
    tradition-bearing household.
  * The buyer likely saw the door, realized who might be inside, and was
    not ready to knock.

Herda’s recommendation:
- She tells Borian that if he wants to intercept the buyer without
  endangering or intruding on her household, he should wait not at her
  door but along the corridor the buyer used to approach.
- She identifies the overhang corridor—a narrow, shadowed stretch with
  no direct windows—as the ideal spot: a place no one looks at twice and
  every visitor must pass.

Gesture and departure:
- Borian thanks Herda for her time and insight.
- He offers the sprig of calming mint (originally from Lidena) back to
  Herda, saying she can make better use of it. Herda accepts with quiet
  appreciation, recognizing the respect in the gesture.
- Herda encourages Borian to “listen before he speaks” if he does meet
  the man next time.

Scene 20 – Overhang Corridor Stakeout – Late Afternoon (Day 3)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Borian leaves Herda’s home and moves to the overhang corridor she
  described:
  * A narrow passage with upper floors bridging above.
  * Sound from the square is muffled here.
  * Anyone heading to Herda’s door must pass this point.

Positioning:
- Borian chooses a spot where:
  * He is not blatantly hiding but can be easily overlooked.
  * He has clear line of sight on the path to the square.

Practice during watch:
- He decides to quietly recite prayers as he waits, using the time to
  deepen his focus rather than idle.
  * This is explicitly intended as practice in disciplined vigilance and
    spiritual centering, not as distraction.
- The corridor sees light passing traffic—residents and the occasional
  city-dweller—but no one matching the shard-buyer’s description.

End of session:
- By late afternoon, there is still no sign of the buyer returning.
- Session ends with Borian maintaining his watch, calm and alert, ready
  to notice any future disturbance.

    completed. Ongoing.
  * Granary understructure anomalies – still open, not advanced this
    session.
  * Missing fisher – Joren Vale – untouched this session, still on the
    board.

Allies / Relationships:
- Bram (Frost-Kiln foreman):
  * Respects Borian’s willingness to stay and his honest assessment of
    what he does and does not know.
  * Is likely to speak well of Borian to the Hall once he files.
- Anonymous messenger contact:
  * Sees Borian as reliable; job handled without drama.
- Aleron:
  * Trust in Borian’s discretion increased via acceptance of a higher-
    risk, better-paying inquiry.
- Kessa:
  * Now sees Borian as a useful contact who keeps his word about favors.
- Tavran:
  * Positive impression reinforced by Borian’s prestidigitation help.
- Lidena:
  * Believes Borian exercises caution around strange doors and unknown
    households.
- Herda Fenwater:
  * Recognizes Borian as someone willing to listen and wrestle with
    competing claims, not merely a paid thief.

HIDDEN DM THREADS (NOT FOR CODEX)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Frost-Kiln seam:
  * The “shadow at the seam” and ventstone disturbance are another
    manifestation of the deeper understructure anomalies hinted at in
    prior sessions (granary, Shed Two frost, Shed Three carved stone).
  * Shutting down the line and Bram’s report will ripple into guild /
    civic decisions.

- Shard-keeper’s fate:
  * The shard’s saddlebag origin is tied to a specific Surnhal traveler
    who died on the road. The precise event is undecided but will be
    consistent with earlier lore once revealed.

- Surnhal families:
  * At least one of the five families (Fenwater, Velthran, Lethamir,
    Daelrun, Tairneth) is actively seeking to reclaim the shard. The
    buyer is acting as proxy, not principal.
  * Herda’s knowledge is broader than she has yet shared; she held back
    one nuance about loom activation and emotional resonance.

- Private collector vs lineage:
  * The private collector’s motives intersect with lineage claims but
    are not identical. There is potential for conflict if both come
    close to the shard at once.

- Kessa’s favor:
  * Her implied “favor” hook can be cashed in during a later market or
    guild tension scene.

- Dead-drop network:
  * The courier work and the earlier missed meet continue to tie Borian
    into Varengate’s shadow communication networks. Different factions
    (guilds, independents, Quiet Hands, or similar) may now recognize
    him as available for deniable work.

SESSION END STATE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Location: Overhang corridor leading into Herda Fenwater’s square,
  east-tier Varengate.
- Time: Late afternoon, Day 3 in Varengate.
- Condition: No active injuries; no special conditions. Normal fatigue
  from extended activity, but no mechanical penalties.
- Outstanding hooks / contracts:
  * Frost-Kiln firewatch: completed physically, awaiting pay / closure.
  * Shard-recovery for private collector: active; shard not yet located.
  * Granary understructure anomalies (three disturbed sheds): unresolved.
  * Missing fisher – Joren Vale: still open on Hall board.
  * Potential future involvement with Surnhal lineage claimants to the
    memory-loom shard.
  * Favor owed or available with Kessa at Grayharp Market.
