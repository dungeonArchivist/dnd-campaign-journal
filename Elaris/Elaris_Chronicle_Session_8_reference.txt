SESSION SUMMARY (HIGH LEVEL)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Borian spends a full, combat-free day weaving himself more tightly
into Varengate’s rhythms.

In the deep hours he shares quiet tea and firelight with Torven,
speaking openly of the "accident" that ended his career and the men
he lost. The talk sharpens his own question: pursue the truth at
home or allow the dead their uneasy rest.

Across the morning and early afternoon he studies lockwork at
Gildery Stacks, buys a set of practice locks from Harn the
locksmith, and begins practical training. He revisits the Tidemother
shrine and walks the harbor, quietly reinforcing his reputation as a
thoughtful outsider rather than a proselytizing foreigner.

Later he takes follow-up work at the western granary, confirms that
the strange residues and tracks have not expanded, and reports this
calmly to the Hall. Administrative details catch up: the delayed
coin from his harbor watch and the ongoing absence of Aleron’s
"quiet settlement."

The latter half of the day is spent in the upper tiers: High Garden,
the Hall of Tides, Merchant Terrace, and the Brass Knot. Borian
deliberately observes etiquette, clothing, and habits of the
wealthy. He fetches his completed cold-weather finery from Hethra
Vane, sends his older gear to the laundry, and begins to blend more
convincingly with the city’s upper crust – without yet being drawn
into their politics.

DETAILED CONTINUITY – SCENE BY SCENE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Scene 1 – Anchorfall Hearth, Tea, and Torven (Deep Night to Predawn)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Borian completes his trance in the small hours and comes
  downstairs to a dark, cooling common room.
- Rather than leave a fire unattended later, he builds it up now:
  lays fresh wood, then uses Prestidigitation to kindle it and
  gently warm a kettle of leftover tea.
- He sits alone with the crackling fire, turning over the same
  questions that drove him from home: the "accident," the men he
  lost, his belief that there was foul play he could never prove,
  and the pressure from above that forced him out instead of
  answering those questions.
- Torven eventually enters from the back, surprised but not
  alarmed to see Borian awake at that hour. He comments gently that
  the paladin is "carrying something heavy" and joins him near the
  hearth.
- Borian speaks more plainly than before about the lost men, the
  families, and whether reopening the past truly serves them or only
  himself. He worries about letting others see him as their
  "answer" rather than someone passing through to help.
- Torven offers no easy absolution. He speaks instead of longshore
  accidents, empty stools at his own tables, and how grief leaves
  no clean ledger. His advice leans toward small, living mercies
  rather than heroic closure.
- The conversation ends not with a firm decision but with mutual
  respect and a shared understanding that some questions may never
  be answered. Torven returns to his early-morning work as the sky
  lightens behind Frostmere Row.

Scene 2 – Breakfast and Day’s Intention (Early Morning)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- As First Bell approaches, Anchorfall stirs. Borian takes a
  straightforward breakfast (house fare; stew and bread/porridge)
  and mentions to Torven that he plans to visit Gildery Stacks.
- Torven estimates the walk at roughly ten minutes up-tier, giving
  Borian the freedom to linger rather than pace outside locked
  doors.
- Borian finishes his meal with an eye toward heading out
  promptly, wanting to make productive use of the daylight.

Scene 3 – Harbor Walk and Tidemother Shrine (After Dawn)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Rather than go straight uphill, Borian lets his feet carry him
  down Frostmere Row and along the harborfront, eyes and mind
  still heavy from the night’s thoughts.
- At the familiar small Tidemother shrine (as in Session II) he
  pauses. He does not pray to the Tidemother directly, but offers
  quiet words for sailors and families, for safe crossings and calm
  weather in dangerous work.
- The shrine itself remains as before: simple stone, weathered
  carvings, offerings jar, and rail polished by countless hands.
  His presence here is part of a pattern the harborfolk may begin
  to notice, even if this visit draws no new NPCs.

Scene 4 – Baker’s Stall on Frostmere Row (Morning)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Drawn by the smell of fresh bread, Borian follows his nose to a
  small baker’s stall just off Frostmere Row, near where the lane
  begins to slope toward the harbor steps.
- The baker is working early, preparing rolls for inns and street
  trade. She presses a warm roll into his hand without charge when
  he compliments the smell.
- Borian speaks of his training and love of bread: four simple
  ingredients, the visible simplicity of kneading and shaping
  versus the unseen complexity of fermentation and oven spring.
- He mentions that life and duty pulled him away from the trade
  for the sake of family and station.
- He butters the roll, watching the fat melt into the crumb, and
  deliberately leaves a whole silver piece beside the butter crock,
  noting that dairy must be dear in this climate.
- The baker initially protests the overpayment but ultimately
  accepts with a wry comment; she hints that if he lingers in
  Varengate, he may be welcome to "remember" the craft at her
  bakehouse ovens.
- This establishes:
  - Relationship: Rella (Baker) – neutral-warm, curious about Borian.
  - Location detail: Small stall on a side spur off Frostmere Row,
    early-morning trade to inns.

Scene 5 – Gildery Stacks: Lock Theory (Late Morning)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Borian heads uphill to the Gildery Stacks and waits only briefly
  before opening.
- At the desk he asks for material on the history and mechanics of
  locks – wards, tumblers, keyways, and operating principles.
- The clerk (generic Stacks functionary; no strong personality
  imprint yet) produces a practical compendium plus at least one
  lighter overview text.
- Borian selects the more technical compendium and settles into a
  reading table, spending several hours working through diagrams
  and terminology:
  - Ward plates and how simple warded locks defeat casual tampering
    but fail against skilled tools.
  - Tumbler stacks, tolerances, binding order, and the difference
    between "raking" and more precise manipulations.
  - Key geometry and why small imperfections matter more in higher
    grade locks.
- By noon, he has extracted what he can from a first pass without
  tools in hand. He checks the compendium out (short-term lending
  fee paid in silver) intending to pair theory with practice using
  actual locks.
- The compendium becomes a referenced item in inventory and a
  cornerstone for future downtime training.

Scene 6 – Midday Meal and Quiet Observation (Near Noon)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Leaving the Stacks, Borian finds a quieter tavern uphill from
  Frostmere Row and orders a simple midday meal (stew and tea).
- No major hooks fire here; the scene reinforces the sense of
  Varengate’s working-day rhythm on the ridge – clerks, minor
  officials, and tradespeople on short breaks.
- Borian remains largely to himself, using the meal as a pause
  between mental and practical study.

Scene 7 – Locksmith Harn’s Stall (Early Afternoon)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Following directions, Borian locates a locksmith’s stall and
  workshop (Harn’s place) somewhere between the Stacks and the
  ridge.
- He explains he wants to secure a few chests and also "tinker"
  with the mechanisms.
- Harn responds with a practical demonstration:
  - A simple warded lock – broad bow, shallow bit, sturdy ward
    plates – described as "keeps honest hands honest."
  - A double-tumbler lock – tighter tolerances, smoother action,
    more resistant to clumsy tampering.
  - A harbor-grade pin lock – smaller pins, fine tolerances,
    typical for clerks’ document chests and some ship lockers.
- Borian buys all three, paying in full per earlier pricing.
- He also signals interest in learning more than just key use.
  Harn remarks that if Borian develops a steady hand and respect
  for the craft, there may be room for informal instruction and
  perhaps paid help on tough jobs later.
- This scene anchors:
  - Harn as a potential mentor and contact in lockcraft.
  - The three practice locks as narrative tools for downtime
    training and future infiltration/problem-solving.

Scene 8 – Hall of Free Companies: Board Glance (Later Afternoon)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Borian returns to the Hall to scan the job board. He filters out
  anything paying less than 5 sp, treating low-pay filler as
  background work for others.
- He notes the familiar granary disturbance posting and other
  minor tasks but is not yet ready to descend again that day; the
  memory of Joren’s rescue and the understructure is still recent.
- No new contract is taken at this moment. Aleron is not present;
  Borian notes his absence but does not press the matter.

Scene 9 – Anchorfall: Cider, Locks, and Study (Late Afternoon / Evening)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Back at Anchorfall, Borian orders hot cider and settles near the
  hearth, compendium and new locks laid out before him.
- He works systematically:
  - Opening, closing, and re-keying the locks with their proper
    keys.
  - Comparing internal diagrams from the book with the feel of the
    mechanisms in hand.
  - Paying attention to the "give" and feedback when pins or wards
    engage.
- This session marks one of the explicit lock-training scenes
  counted in the state file (see training_progress).
- Supper is taken at the inn; no new contacts are introduced here.
  The focus is internal: skills, not social reach.

Scene 10 – Night Reading and Trance (Night, End of First Cycle)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- After supper, Borian continues reading and lock practice until
  late evening.
- He then returns to his room, performs basic gear checks, and
  enters his elven trance, intending to rise early but not in the
  deep watches.
- Trance completes near pre-dawn, leaving him fully rested and
  ready for a more administratively focused day.

Scene 11 – Morning Gear Repack and Breakfast (Day 6 Morning)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Recognizing that his pack is overstuffed, Borian lightens his
  carried load:
  - Leaves extra rations, most of his torches, and a spare rope in
    his room as "reserve stock."
  - Keeps a single day of rations, a reduced number of torches, and
    essential tools on his person.
- He heads downstairs for breakfast, exchanges brief pleasantries
  with Torven, and then makes his way toward the Hall once again to
  seek paying work.

Scene 12 – Hall Board and Granary Follow-Up (Morning)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- At the Hall, Borian checks the board and this time takes the
  renewed "Granary disturbance" posting – a follow-up visit rather
  than a fresh contract.
- The clerk recognizes him as the previous investigator and has no
  new information beyond reports of "strange cold" and the desire
  for reassurance.
- No new terms are added; this is treated more as civic duty than
  a lucrative bounty.

Scene 13 – Western Granary and Sheds (Late Morning)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- At the western granary, Borian meets Drett again. Drett explains
  that things have been mostly quiet: fewer noises, some odd cold
  spots, but no fresh damage.
- Borian takes a lantern and descends into the cellar:
  - He notes lingering chill and faint residue consistent with
    prior understructure anomalies but sees no new breaches, growths,
    or signs of recent intrusion.
- Back outside, he and Drett walk the rear sheds:
  - Trails and scuffs remain similar to his earlier observations:
    lines of disturbance pointing toward deeper city interior but
    not obviously spreading.
  - The pattern feels "of a piece" with Cooper’s Run and Shed Two
    from earlier sessions – same family of phenomena, not a new
    variant.
- Borian is frank with Drett: nothing worse than last time; no
  current sign of vermin or active structural threat, only the
  unnerving, unfamiliar traces. He promises to relay this to the
  Hall.

Scene 14 – Hall Report and Payment Administration (Midday)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Returning to the Hall, Borian files a brief, factual report:
  same type and scale of anomaly, no expansion, and no immediate
  danger to grain or workers.
- The clerk signs off and authorizes modest payment.
- Borian also checks in with the bursar regarding the previous
  day’s dockside watch assist at the north pier (short duty where
  payment was delayed). The bursar confirms the paperwork and pays
  out the owed gold.
- This scene cleans up the outstanding harbor watch coin and makes
  the granary follow-up "current" without resolving the deeper
  understructure mystery.

Scene 15 – Frostmere Row Outfitter: Second Backpack (Early Afternoon)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- With his gear reorganization in mind, Borian visits a general
  outfitter on Frostmere Row and purchases a standard backpack.
- This will serve as in-room storage for surplus kit and clothing.
- The interaction is strictly transactional; the merchant does not
  yet become a distinct contact.

Scene 16 – Hethra Vane’s Clothwork: Cold-Weather Finery (Early Afternoon)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Borian returns to Hethra Vane to collect the cold-weather fine
  clothes commissioned back in Session I.
- The garments are tailored to local fashions while respectful of
  his frame and bearing: coat, layers, and boots that would not
  look out of place on Merchant Terrace yet remain practical in the
  northern cold.
- He tries them on, receives final adjustments, and chooses to wear
  them out rather than stow them.
- Final payment of the 8 gp balance is made, closing the original
  clothing contract and cementing Hethra’s view of him as a
  reliable customer.

Scene 17 – South Row Laundry: Old Clothes Forwarded (Early Afternoon)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Back at Anchorfall, Borian gathers his everyday traveler’s
  clothes and older cold-weather layers, bundles them, and takes
  them to a South Row laundry recommended by Torven.
- He requests a standard wash and dry and arranges for the cleaned
  garments to be sent back to Anchorfall for "Borian," with Torven
  as the contact.
- He pays the laundress appropriately in silver and confirms that
  the name and destination are clearly noted.
- This establishes:
  - Laundry as a minor, repeatable service contact.
  - Anchorfall as an even more fully integrated home base.

Scene 18 – Upper Tiers: Overlook Walk and High Garden Paths (Mid Afternoon)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Dressed in his new finery, Borian climbs to the upper tiers with
  two goals:
  - Learn the physical pathways and vantage points.
  - Observe noble and wealthy customs to better blend in.
- On Overlook Walk he spends time at a bench facing the harbor.
  Attempted perception here is poor (low roll); he takes in only
  generalities: passing couples, minor officials, distant ships,
  and the broad sweep of breakwaters.
- In the High Garden paths, he moves through landscaped terraces
  and statuary, again mostly observing. The key encounter here is
  an artist.

Scene 19 – Stonecarver’s Sketch (High Garden)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Borian notices a young stonecarver sketching a fountain in
  charcoal. He approaches quietly, looking over the work without
  crowding.
- He compliments the sketch, apologizing for the intrusion. A brief
  exchange follows:
  - The carver explains that this is practice for stonework, where
    mistakes are less forgiving than charcoal.
  - Borian mentions limited past experience with ceramics and oils,
    noting that painting has been neglected of late.
- He asks whether the artist signs finished work; she explains her
  personal mark – three angled lines – used on carved stone.
- Borian offers thanks, wishes her good light, and withdraws so as
  not to waste her time.
- Ongoing hook: Borian may later recognize her mark on city
  stonework, providing a personal thread into artisan circles.

Scene 20 – Hall of Tides: Maps, Artifacts, and Harbor Model (Late Afternoon)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Borian visits the Hall of Tides, a civic-maritime institution at
  the upper tiers.
- He studies:
  - Large coastal maps showing Varengate’s position relative to
    northern routes, headlands, and outer shoals.
  - Displayed relics from earlier eras of the city’s harbor work.
  - A detailed harbor model with movable ships, piers, and
    breakwaters.
- He looks closely for hidden marks or irregularities on the model
  but finds nothing beyond the expected detail.
- He leaves with a better mental picture of:
  - Approaches to Varengate by sea.
  - The placement of breakwaters and beacon structures.
  - The city’s development around layered tiers and harbors.

Scene 21 – Merchant Terrace Teahouse (Late Afternoon)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Borian proceeds to Merchant Terrace and chooses a respectable
  teahouse with harbor views.
- He orders a tea selected specifically to "keep him going in the
  afternoon but not awake all night" and sits near a window.
- He quietly observes upper-tier patrons:
  - Merchants and stewards weighing contracts and ledgers.
  - Minor nobles and courtiers using public space as a stage for
    quiet power.
  - Etiquette norms: modest displays of wealth, controlled voices,
    careful attention to who greets whom.
- No explicit hooks are triggered, but Borian internalizes these
  cues for future social maneuvering.

Scene 22 – Bookbinder’s Loft (Late Afternoon)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Still on Merchant Terrace, he visits a bookbinder’s shop rich
  with leather, paper, and glue smells.
- The proprietor is polite but not intrusive; Borian browses
  shelves.
- He pulls down "On the Tiers of Varengate," skims its contents,
  and notes that it offers a structured, civic-approved summary of
  the city’s tiers, governance, and history.
- He returns the book to the shelf without purchase, but now knows
  such a resource exists should he need to consult or purchase it
  later.

Scene 23 – Terrace Supper (Early Evening)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Borian identifies a small terrace eatery near the Brass Knot and
  takes a two-seat table so as not to monopolize space.
- He orders lamb and tea. The meal is solid, not ostentatious, and
  confirms that his clothing and manners are sufficient to avoid
  standing out.
- He pays the bill and leaves a modest silver tip when earned,
  reinforcing a pattern of quiet generosity.

Scene 24 – The Brass Knot (Evening)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- At the Brass Knot, Borian takes a seat at the bar and orders
  spiced wine.
- He surveys the clientele:
  - Mid-tier merchants, junior officers, some caravan or ship
    representatives, but no obvious high nobles or great-house
    patrons.
  - Conversations center on shipping schedules, contracts, and
    routine business rather than conspiracies.
- He had hoped to suss out rumors of private contracts or higher-
  level needs, but nothing compelling surfaces here tonight.
- Socially, this marks the Brass Knot as a respectable but not
  elite hub – useful for information about commerce and mid-tier
  concerns, less so for direct access to the city’s ruling layer.

Scene 25 – Anchorfall: Unpaid Quiet Settlement and Rest (Night)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Returning to Anchorfall, Borian checks with Torven about Aleron
  Vale’s promised "quiet" payment for previous understructure work.
- Torven confirms that nothing has arrived yet, but expresses
  confidence that Aleron is not one to forget such matters. If the
  delay stretches longer, Torven may inquire discreetly.
- Borian accepts this for now, cleans up, and returns to his room.
- The day ends with another elven trance, fully restorative and
  free of visions or disturbances.

ALLIES / RELATIONSHIPS CHANGES
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Torven (Anchorfall Inn):
  - Relationship deepened through honest conversation about loss
    and purpose.
  - Sees Borian as a man wrestling with grief rather than a
    swaggering sellsword.
- Western Granary – Drett:
  - Confidence maintained. Drett accepts Borian’s assessment that
    nothing has worsened yet, and that the matter is in the Hall’s
    hands.
- Baker (Frostmere Row):
  - New contact. Warm initial impression; Borian overpays in thanks
    and respect. Potential future opportunity to reconnect over
    baking.
- Harn the Locksmith:
  - New mentor-quality contact. Open to future instruction and
    possible paid technical work if Borian’s skill grows.
- Laundry (South Row):
  - Minor service contact. Knows Borian’s name and Anchorfall as
    his lodging.
- Stonecarver in High Garden:
  - Named only by mark (three angled lines). Future recognition of
    her work could form a relationship thread.
- Upper-tier service staff (teahouse, eatery, Brass Knot):
  - No specific relationships yet, but Borian has made a neutral to
    mildly positive impression as a courteous, appropriately
    dressed outsider.

ITEMS / CONTRACTS CHANGES
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Items gained:
- Three practice locks (warded, double-tumbler, harbor-grade pin).
- Lock Mechanisms Compendium (borrowed from Gildery Stacks).

Items updated:
- Cold-weather finery from Hethra Vane – fully paid and now worn;
  marks Borian as presentable in upper-tier settings.
- Second backpack for in-room storage of excess gear.

Items lost / committed:
- None permanently lost this session; coin expenditures tracked in
  state YAML.

Contracts – open:
- Granary understructure disturbances:
  - Status: Phenomena unchanged but confirmed. No active threat to
    grain, but pattern remains part of broader understructure
    mystery.
- Harbor drift / cold anomaly pattern (unofficial):
  - Aleron’s quiet interest persists. No formal new contract, but
    Borian’s observations feed this thread.

Contracts – closed:
- No new formal contracts fully closed this session.
- Administrative closure: dockside watch assist now fully paid.

TRAINING / SKILL PROGRESS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Lock-work / picking proficiency (downtime track):
- Scenes this session:
  - Theoretical study at Gildery Stacks.
  - Practical lock handling and comparison at Anchorfall.
  - Purchase and initial exploration of three different lock types
    with Harn’s explanations.
- Cumulative scenes: 3 (as per Session 8 state).
- Status: In progress. Conceptual foundation established; practical
  proficiency will require further downtime with tools and
  deliberate practice.

HIDDEN DM THREADS (NOT FOR CODEX)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Understructure Anomaly Pattern:
  - Western granary residues and trails remain aligned with prior
    events (Cooper’s Run, Frost-Kiln seam, Shed Two).
  - Lack of apparent growth is itself information: whatever is
    moving beneath Varengate is not yet in rapid expansion but is
    persistent and systemic.
- Aleron’s Quiet Settlement:
  - Delay in payment may be mundane bureaucracy or a deliberate
    pacing choice by Aleron, measuring Borian’s patience and
    discretion before deeper trust or risk is extended.
- Social Positioning:
  - Borian’s new clothing and careful behavior in Merchant Terrace
    and upper tiers mark him as a potential bridge between harbor
    folk and higher circles.
  - Future invitations, contracts, or entanglements can believably
    originate from either side without feeling forced.
- Artisan Threads:
  - Stonecarver’s mark (three angled lines) gives a physical
    breadcrumb for later discoveries – statues, facades, or small
    works linking back to her and to artisan gossip.
- Faith and Reputation:
  - Repeated, quiet appearances at the Tidemother shrine continue
    to stain the ether around Borian as "the foreigner who still
    prays for sailors." This can soften attitudes among fishers,
    dock families, and some minor clergy.
- Lockcraft and Future Problems:
  - Borian’s growing interest in locks provides a grounded, non-
    magical route into infiltration, evidence-gathering, and secure
    storage challenges later on.
  - Harn’s potential mentorship anchors this growth in-world rather
    than as sudden unearned skill.
